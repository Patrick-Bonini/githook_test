    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud;Appliance;Software"/>Guaranteed Message Queuing Limits</h1>
    <p>The maximum number of Guaranteed messages that <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> event brokers can queue at one time for delivery will be cumulatively reduced by the following factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the number of messages that provisioned endpoints receive—If a single published message is queued for delivery on <i>n</i> endpoints, that counts as <i>n</i> messages queued for delivery, even though only one copy of the message is stored by the event broker.</li>
      <li>whether data from the event broker is being replicated—When the replication facility is used, a copy of a message in the replication queue counts as another message queued for delivery. That is, if a message is queued for delivery on <span class="Emphasis">n</span> endpoints, and it is to be replicated, that counts as <span class="Emphasis">n </span>+1 messages queued for delivery.</li>
      <li>whether the event broker is processing transactions—When transactions are used, the event broker has to maintain extra information for each message in a transaction until the transaction is committed or rolled back. </li>
      <li>whether there are provisioned endpoints configured to respect published messages’ TTL expiry times—When an endpoint respects a message’s TTL, the TTL is recorded and maintained until the message is consumed or discarded.</li>
    </ul>
