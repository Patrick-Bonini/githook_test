    <h1>System-Level Subscription Exception Configuration</h1>
    <p>This section provides information on how to enable or disable subscription exceptions for a Solace PubSub+ event broker.</p>
    <p>When subscription exceptions are enabled, a leading "!" character in a  queue topic or MQTT QoS-1 subscription   (for example !a/b/c) indicates a subscription exception. Any messages published to a topic matching a subscription exception are discarded and not delivered to the  queue. When subscription exceptions are disabled, a leading "!" character in a topic subscription is treated as a literal character. </p>
    <p>Also, wildcard characters can be used in subscription exceptions in the same way as in topic subscriptions, see <MadCap:xref href="../Wildcard-Charaters-Topic-Subs.htm" target="_blank">Wildcard Characters in Topic Subscriptions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Subscription exceptions are not supported for the following use cases. In these instances, leading "!" characters are always treated as literal characters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct Messaging subscriptions</li>
      <li>MQTTÂ QoS-0 topic subscriptions</li>
      <li>ACL topic exceptions</li>
      <li>PubSub+ Cache topics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subscription exceptions are enabled by default. To disable or enable subscription exceptions, do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To disable subscription exceptions, enter the following CONFIG command:<p class="Code">solace(configure/system/topic-routing)# no subscription-exceptions [defer]</p></li>
      <li>To enable subscription exceptions, enter the following CONFIG command:<p class="Code">solace(configure/system/topic-routing)# subscription-exceptions [defer]</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><u>Where</u>:</p>
    <p><code>defer</code> specifies to defer the change until the next event broker restart.</p>
    <p>You must restart the event broker before changes take effect. If you do not specify the <code>defer</code> keyword, you are immediately prompted to restart the event broker. </p>
    <div class="Note">
      <p> Config-Sync does not automatically synchronize this property. Therefore, if the event broker is being used in a high-availability (HA) pair or in a replicated site, you must manually configure the  property on each mate event broker.</p>
