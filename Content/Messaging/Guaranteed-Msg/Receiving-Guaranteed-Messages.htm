    <h1>Receiving Guaranteed Messages</h1>
    <p>To receive published Guaranteed messages, a client must create a consumer flow to bind to a queue endpoint or a topic endpoint provisioned on the event broker with the spooled published messages. Once the consumer is bound to the endpoint, and it has an active consumer flow (that is, a flow through which messages are being delivered), it can consume Guaranteed messages spooled to that endpoint.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>Client binds to a queue</u>
      </li>
      <p>The client can be an exclusive or non-exclusive consumer of messages spooled to that endpoint. For information on exclusive and non-exclusive consumers, refer to <MadCap:xref href="Endpoints.htm#Queue_Access_Types">Queue Access Types</MadCap:xref>.</p>
      <li>
        <u>Client binds to a topic endpoint</u>
      </li>
      <p>The client provides the topic subscription that it wants the endpoint to spool messages for. The topic subscription that a topic endpoint will spool messages for is not specified when a topic endpoint is provisioned.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>When a consuming client successfully receives a Guaranteed message, a corresponding application acknowledgment is required to indicate to the event broker that the client application received the message, so then the message can be removed from the endpoint.</p>
