    <p class="fortechreview" MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">As part of your event-driven integration strategy, <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_short"/> offer a seamless approach to easily perform smaller integrations rather than creating monolithic data integrations that span many days and weeks. Unlike synchronous integrations which can become complex, fragile, and hard to change because of potential impact to other external systems and integrations, <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.Cloud_connector_generic"/>s focus on specific, narrowly defined tasks or processes so they are easier to design and change without impact to any other systems because the effect and risk of the change is localized. In our context, an external system encompasses any platform or service that sends data or messages, including applications, databases, and messaging services. Examples of such external systems include <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.connector-ibmmq-product-name"/>, <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.connector-awssqs-product-name"/>, and <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.connector-gcppubsub-product-name"/>. </p>
    <p>Micro-integrations are small, lightweight, event-driven integration modules that connect enterprise technologies (legacy and SaaS applications, messaging services, databases, files, AI agents etc.) to an event-driven distribution layer, so they can exchange information in real-time. Micro-Integrations are to integration and connectivity what microservices are to application architectures: they decompose a monolithic integration flow into smaller, more manageable, purpose-built components.</p>
    <p>A micro-integration includes a source or target connector  which establishes data flow between an event distribution layer such as an event broker or an event mesh and some other source or target system. They can (but do not always) also include one or more functions that modify the message’s content such as payload transformation, data enrichment or validation, or header modification.</p>

    <p>Using <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_short"/> results in rapid event integrations completed within minutes. <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>s are available in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/> and allow you to manage and observe the state of an integration between your external system, and an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> or event mesh.  When you use <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>s, you can focus on streamlining the details of the event-driven integration rather than managing the operational overhead of the infrastructure associated with an event-driven integrations allowing you to have better flexibility and improved scalability.</p>
    <h2><a name="understand-connector-flows"/>Understanding <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>s</h2>
    <p>A <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> represents the flow of data between an external system and a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. There are two types of <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>s:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <i>target</i> <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow" style="font-style: italic;"/> is where data flows from the  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" style="font-style: italic;"/> to the external system.</li>
      <li>A <i>source</i> <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> is where data flows from the external system to the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You decide at creation time whether to create a source or target <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>.</p>

    <p>You can create and manage <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>s in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>. The workflow for using <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud-connector-ui"/>s is as follows:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Decide and Discover </dt>
      <dd>You find the right <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> and decide  to create a source or target <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>. Many of the  <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.self-managed-connectors"/> that are available in the <a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.ConnectorIntegrationHub%]" target="_blank" class="link-offsite"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> Integration Hub</a> are available in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_long"/>. See <MadCap:xref href="discover-micro-integrations-available.htm">Discovering Connectors in [%=Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only%] Cloud</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Design </dt>
      <dd>You create and configure the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> that requires knowledge of your external system's details, such as connection details, queue names, etc. These details are necessary to configure the source or target of the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="create-micro-integration.htm">Designing Connector Flows</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Deploy and Observe</dt>
      <dd>You deploy and observe your <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> to ensure that it fulfills your requirements. Unlike <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.pubsub_self_contained_connector_titlecase"/>s, <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_short"/>s provide a way to visualize the state of the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> and allows you to focus on the details of the data flows between the external system and your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="manage-micro-integrations.htm#deploy-connector-flow">Deploying A Connector Flow</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Update and Evolve</dt>
      <dd>You can iterate and modify the configuration settings as required. Before making modifications, you must undeploy the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>. After you make updates to the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>, you can redeploy it. If the created connector flow doesn't perform as expected, you can also delete it and restart the design.

    <h3><a name="flow-states"/><MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> States </h3>
    <p>After creating a <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>, you manage its various states manage the flow of data between the external system and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. The following are the various states:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Not Deployed</dt>
      <dd>When you undeploy a <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>, it transitions from Running to Undeploying, and then to Not Deployed state. A <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> starts in the Not Deployed state when it's first created. In the Not Deployed state, data does not flow between your external system and the  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>.</dd>
      <dt>Deploying</dt>
      <dd>A transient state that indicates the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> is in the process of being deployed. If successful, data will start to flow between the external system and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>.</dd>
      <dt>Running</dt>
      <dd>When you deploy a <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>, it transitions from it's current state to Deploying, and then the Running state. In the Running state, data flows between your external system and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>.</dd>
      <dt>Undeploying</dt>
      <dd>A transient state that indicates that the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> is the process of being undeployed, and the flow of data is stopping between  your external system and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>.</dd>
      <dt>Unable to Deploy</dt>
      <dd>If an error condition occurs during the deployment of the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> and the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> cannot be deployed, the state transitions from the Deploying state to the Unable to Deploy state. When you view the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/>, the reasons for the errors are displayed in the error text.</dd>
      <dt>Down</dt>
      <dd>If an error condition occurs with a <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> and recovery is not possible, the <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Connectors.cloud_managed_connector_flow"/> moves to the Down state. When you view the connector, the reasons for the errors are displayed in the error text.</dd>
