    <h1>Release Version Management and Best Practices</h1>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> recommends using Production Long-Term Support (LTS) event broker releases in all mature production deployments.</p>
    <p>For all <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> event broker Production and Production LTS releases that are in full support, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> regularly releases maintenance updates that address security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes. Solace strongly recommends that you update your event brokers and event broker services every six months to incorporate the most recent maintenance updates.</p>
    <p>You will receive Product Notifications from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> regarding the availability of those maintenance updates. It is your responsibility to review these notifications and update your event brokers and event broker services. To update the email address these notifications are sent to, or associate other email addresses with your account, please <a href="../get-support.htm" target="_blank" class="link-internal">contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></a>.</p>
    <p>For more information about the availability and release type of each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> product, see <a href="https://solace.com/support/support-dates-for-release-versions/" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Support Dates for Release Versions</a>.</p>
