    <h1>Configuring Message VPNs for Caching</h1>
    <p>The following considerations should be made for a Message VPN that will contain the Distributed Cache:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the Global Caching feature is to be used, the subscription export policy must be enabled (for information, refer to <MadCap:xref href="Configuring-Global-Cachi.htm">Considerations for Implementing Global Caching</MadCap:xref>). By default, this policy is not enabled.</li>
      <li>If the new topic advertisements feature is to be used, the publishing of Message VPN events must be enabled (for information, refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:subscribing_to_message_bus_events_1651767527_46950" href="../../Monitoring/Receiving-Message-Bus-Events.htm#subscribing_to_message_bus_events_1651767527_349092">Publishing Message VPN-Level Events</MadCap:xref>. By default, this policy is not enabled.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">For releases before 10.0.1, Distributed Cache Management services must be enabled for the Message VPN (for information, refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:managing_message_vpns_2096211297_33604" href="Configuring-Distributed-.htm#Enable-Dist-Caches">Enabling Distributed Caches</MadCap:xref>). Distributed Cache Management services allows the event broker that the Message VPN is hosted on to manage the configuration of PubSub+ Cache Instances and to synchronize them. 
			<p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">The event broker with a Message VPN that has Distributed Cache Management services enabled acts as the Designated Router for that Message VPN. By default, when a Message VPN is created, Distributed Cache Management services are enabled.</p><p class="Note" MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">In addition for releases prior to 10.0.1, Distributed Cache Management services must be enabled for a Message VPN, otherwise <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_cache"/> service will be unavailable. However, if a Message VPN of the same name is hosted on multiple event brokers that are connected in networked deployment, Distributed Cache Management services must only be enabled on one of those Messages VPNs. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="PubSub-Cache-Redundancy-and-Network-Deployments.htm">Redundancy and Network Deployments</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
