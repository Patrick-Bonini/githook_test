    <h1>Monitoring PubSub+ Cache</h1>
    <p>This section describes how you can configure event parameters on a per Cache Cluster basis, and how to monitor events and logs generated by PubSub+ Cache Instances. It also describes the <code>show</code> commands you can use to monitor PubSub+ Cache's configuration and operational status, and provides some guidance for using Solace Element Management Protocol (SEMP) to monitor and manage a PubSub+ Cache implementation.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="pubsubcache-events"/>PubSub+ Cache Events</h2>
    <p>Each PubSub+ Cache Instance uses an event queue with a maximum depth of 10 events, and it only removes an event from this queue once it gets an acknowledgment (that is, an ACK) back from the Cache Manager. If its queue is full, the PubSub+ Cache Instance raises syslog events locally until a connection to the message bus is established. It can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>locally raise the <code>VPN_SOLCACHE_LOSS_OF_NOTIFICATION</code> event</li>
      <li>locally raise the event that could not be sent back to the cache manager</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a complete list of PubSub+ Cache events, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../Monitoring/PubSub-Event-Reference.htm">SolOS Event Reference</MadCap:xref>, which lists and describes Solace PubSub+ syslog messages related to system-wide, Message VPN, and local client Solace PubSub+ events. </p>
