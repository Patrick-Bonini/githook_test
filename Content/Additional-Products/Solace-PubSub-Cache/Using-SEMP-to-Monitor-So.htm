    <h1>Using SEMP to Monitor PubSub+ Cache</h1>
    <p>SEMP is a request/reply protocol that uses an XML schema to identify all objects managed in a Solace PubSub+ event broker. Any object available through the Solace CLI is also available through SEMP.</p>
    <p>XML-encoded SEMP requests parallel the commands offered through the CLI, therefore, management applications can use SEMP requests and replies to manage and monitor Solace PubSub+. For example, when using PubSub+ Cache, an application can regularly poll local and remote PubSub+ Cache Instances by sending SEMP-based show commands and viewing the instancesâ€™ contents that are provided in the replies.</p>
    <p>The SEMP XML-encoded commands and replies are either wrapped in HTTP requests and responses and sent over a TCP connection (SEMP Request over HTTP) to the management interface, or sent over the event broker message bus (SEMP Request Over Message Bus) using one of the Solace messaging APIs.</p>
    <p>For information on using the router SEMP Request Over Message Bus service, refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:using_semp_to_manage_and_monitor_routers_4217350357_38232" href="../../Admin/SEMP/Using-Legacy-SEMP.htm">

    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="semp-polling-frequency-guidelines"/>SEMP Polling Frequency Guidelines</h2>
    <p>An event broker supports a maximum SEMP polling rate of ten requests per second. </p>
    <p class="Note">When you are using SEMP Request Over Message Bus service and a more-cookie is returned, the single page constitute a single request. For information on oversized responses and the more-cookie, refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:using_semp_to_manage_and_monitor_routers_4217350357_35873" href="../../Admin/SEMP/Using-Legacy-SEMP.htm#SEMP7">SEMP Request  Paging</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>The following SEMP requests should not be polled more than once every 30 seconds due to the large amounts of data that could be returned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>show cache-instance &lt;name&gt; remote status</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>show cache-instance &lt;name&gt; remote topics</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>show smrp subscriptions</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following SEMP requests should not be polled.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>show queue &lt;name&gt; message-vpn &lt;name&gt; messages</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>show topic-endpoint &lt;name&gt; message-vpn &lt;name&gt; messages</code>
      </li>
