    <h1>Customizing PubSub+ Cache Instance Configuration Files</h1>
    <p>Each installed PubSub+ Cache Instance process receives its configuration parameters through two sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a configuration file specified at invocation (used to connect to the event broker)</li>
      <li>the Designated Router—the Solace Cache Instance learns additional configuration information for the PubSub+ Cache Instance from the Designated Router through the event broker message bus</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each PubSub+ Cache Instance requires its own configuration file, and it must be filled out with specifics for your configuration. The <code>sampleConfig.txt</code> file (included with the PubSub+ Cache Instance installation package) is provided as a template.</p>
    <p>The parameters that are passed to an installed PubSub+ Cache Instance through the PubSub+ Cache Instance configuration file include the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>client username and client password to use when connecting to the router</li>
      <li>DNS name or IP address of the router to connect to, and optionally, the DNS name or IP address of a backup router to connect to if the preferred router is unreachable</li>
      <li>Message VPN to join</li>
      <li>unique name that is used to identify the PubSub+ Cache Instance in CLI, and on the router message bus</li>
      <li>local priority, and network priority of the PubSub+ Cache Instance (optional parameters).</li>
      <li>Processor Mask (an optional parameter used to specify which computer processors the PubSub+ Cache Instance can run on)</li>
      <li>name of the file to use when backing up the PubSub+ Cache Instance’s cached messages (refer to <MadCap:xref href="Performing-PubSub-Cache-Admi.htm#configuring_and_managing_solcache_541341864_268648">Backing up and Restoring PubSub+ Cache Instance Messages</MadCap:xref>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To customize the PubSub+ Cache Instance configuration file, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Following the instructions provided within the <code>sampleConfig.txt</code> file, edit a copy of the file with the specifics for your PubSub+ Cache Instance configuration.
                <p class="Note">Ensure that the <code>CACHE_INSTANCE_NAME</code> is the same PubSub+ Cache Instance name that was used for the matching PubSub+ Cache Instance object configured through the Solace CLI (refer to <MadCap:xref href="Configuring-PubSub-Cache-Ins.htm">Configuring PubSub+ Cache Instances</MadCap:xref>).</p></li>
      <li>Save the modified configuration file with a unique identifying file name to one of the following locations:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>If the PubSub+ Cache Instance is to run on a Linux computer, save the file on that Linux computer.</li>
      <li>If the PubSub+ Cache Instance is to run on an event broker, save the file to <br/><code>/usr/sw/solcache/config</code> on that router. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you modify the configuration parameters for a PubSub+ Cache Instance process, you can do either of the following to apply those changes to the PubSub+ Cache Instance process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop and restart the PubSub+ Cache Instance process. When the PubSub+ Cache Instance restarts, it will use the updated configuration parameters provided in the file. </li>
      <li>Use the  PubSub+ Cache service script's “service solcache reload” command to reload the PubSub+ Cache Instance configuration parameters without having to stop the PubSub+ Cache Instance process. When this command is run, the script sends a SIGUSR1 signal to the PubSub+ Cache Instance. Upon receiving the signal, the PubSub+ Cache Instance will re‑read its configuration file and change any properties that may be reloaded. Refer to the <code>sampleConfig.txt </code>configuration file (included with the PubSub+ Cache Instance installation package) for information on which parameters are reloadable.</li>
    </ul>
