    <h1>Solace Geneos SEMP Service Down Alert</h1>
    <p>You can add a rule to see an alert when the SEMP service is down. By adding the rule, the data view under Solace Sampler turns to red, and the stale data is greyed out. If the rule is not created and the SEMP service goes down, stale data will be greyed out, but the data view under Solace Sampler will not change.</p>
    <p>The rule can be manually added as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the <b>Gateway Setup Editor</b>, expand the rules folder.</li>
      <li> Select the <b>Solace Rule</b> group.</li>
      <li>Click on <b>New Rule</b>.</li>
      <li> Give the rule a <b>name</b> of your choice.</li>
      <li>Add the following target to the rule:<p><code>/geneos/gateway[(@name="system-test")]/directory/probe/managedEntity/sampler[(@name="SolaceSampler")]//rows/row/cell[(@column="/FAIL")]</code></p><p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: Â &lt;/b&gt;">Rule target may vary depending on the  environment.  When setting the rule target, do not specify a dataview.  This ensures that the rule applies to all SolGeneos monitors.</p></li>
      <li> Give the rule a block as follows: <code>severity critical</code>.</li>
      <li><b>Save</b> configuration.</li>
    </ol>
