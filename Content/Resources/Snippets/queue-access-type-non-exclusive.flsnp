        <p><code>non-exclusive</code>—specifies that multiple consumers can bind to the queue, which enables load balancing and consumer auto-scaling. A non-exclusive queue can be non-partitioned or partitioned. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For a non-partitioned queue (partition count is zero), each consumer is serviced in a round-robin fashion. If a connection fails, unacknowledged messages are delivered to another consumer with the re-delivered flag set. In this way, messages can be delivered to consumers out of order. This type of queue is sometimes referred to as a "competing consumer" queue. </li>
            <li>For a <a href="../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Queues.htm#partitioned-queues" class="link-internal">partitioned queue</a> (partition count is greater than zero), each consumer is delivered messages from one or more partitions. Messages are mapped to partitions based on a hash of the partition key, which is set by the publishing application. Message order is maintained within a partition, but not between partitions.</li>
        </ul>
