        <p>A modeled event mesh represents an operational event mesh in a specific runtime environment. You create models of event meshes to  help you define and visualize event flows between publishing and subscribing applications within an event-driven architecture (EDA). When you create a modeled event mesh, you associate it with an environment. Each modeled event mesh belongs to a single environment.</p>
