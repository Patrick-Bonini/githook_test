        <p>Event path shows the direction of the event. As shown in the image below, hovering your cursor over an event or application displays an arrow <img src="../../../Images/Event-Portal/drag-drop-arrow-icon.png" style="width: 35px;height: 39px;" /> that you can drag and drop to create a connection between applications and events.
