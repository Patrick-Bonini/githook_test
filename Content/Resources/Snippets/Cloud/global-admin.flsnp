    <p>All <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are configured with a default management account that you can use for CLI access.  This account is separate from the accounts that you use to access the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>. This management account is specific to each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> and has limited access to perform management actions and read-write privileges on only the  Message VPN, which is referred to as Message VPN-scoped account.  The elevated privilege would be admin.</p>
    <p>To enable other features that require elevated scope and access levels, you require an account with elevated privileges on each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. For example, to configure replication you require an account for the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> that has global scope and admin access-level, referred to as a <i>global-admin account</i>. You require a scope of global to configure components other than the Message VPN. You require this global-admin account  for each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> on both the Primary and Backup sites.</p>
    <p>To request a global-admin account, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.NotForPDF"><a href="../../../get-support.htm" target="_blank" class="link-internal">contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlyForPDF"> contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
    <p class="warning">You must exercise caution when you use the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.solace_cli"/> commands with an account with global scope and admin access-level. With this global-admin account, you can run commands that cause service-disruptions. If you  cause a service-disruptions, it voids your service level agreements (SLAs) for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>.</p>
