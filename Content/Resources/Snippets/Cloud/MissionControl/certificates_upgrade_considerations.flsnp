        <p>As mentioned previously, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" />s that were created before 9.8 use a single trust store (e.g., release 9.6) to store CA&#160;certificates for both server and client certificates. When <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" />s migrated to 9.8 from an earlier release, the certificates from the trust store are copied to both the Server Domain Certificate Authorities and  Client Certificate Authorities trust stores. After migration, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> recommends that you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>remove server certificates from the Client Certificate Authorities trust store</li>
            <li>remove the client certificates  from the Server Certificate Authorities trust store</li>
        </ul>
