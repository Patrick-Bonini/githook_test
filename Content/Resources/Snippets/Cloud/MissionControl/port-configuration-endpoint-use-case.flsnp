        <p>Using different endpoints for public Internet and private IP address connectivity allows you specify the protocols and ports used to connect to your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" /> to match the security  requirements of your organization. In addition, you can configure endpoints to permit use of specific messaging protocols and port numbers between client applications and the  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" /> based on whether they connect using public Internet or private IP&#160;addresses.</p>
        <p>For example, you may want to expose an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" /> so that client applications can only connect from the public Internet using only MQTT&#160;ports through port 1122, while clients within your private network using private IP&#160;addresses can connect with all other messaging protocols using the default ports. Another example for hybrid connectivity usage is to limit access to the SEMP&#160;management&#160;port so that only client applications using  private IP&#160;addresses can connect to your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" />s.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput"> If your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" />s are deployed in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region" />, you can configure only a public Internet endpoint because all client applications connect to the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short" />s  from the public Internet.</p>
