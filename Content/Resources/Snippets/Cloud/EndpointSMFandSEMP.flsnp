        <li>One endpoint must have the Secured SMF&#160;port enabled, which is  required for messaging with client applications and for inter-broker communication in an event mesh.</li>
        <li>One endpoint must have the Secured Broker Management Host (SEMP)&#160;port;&#160;the&#160;SEMP&#160;port is required to manage your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"></MadCap:variable>.</li>
