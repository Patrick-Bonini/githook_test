    <li>You can use ports 22 and 943 as custom ports.</li>
    <li>If you are using NodePort as part of your deployment for <a href="../../../Cloud/Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm#customer-owned-vnet" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s</a>, the port numbers are generated and therefore can't be changed. For NodePort deployments, only private endpoints can be used. </li>
