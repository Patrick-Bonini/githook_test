        <p>The permissions shown below are useful for completing the tutorials and for development purposes only to fully utilize the REST&#160;API&#160;capabilities.  API&#160;tokens that you use in production must assign only the minimum set of permissions (a subset of the above permissions) that are required for your client applications to function. For example, don't assign a permission such as Create User or Delete User if the application never needs to manage users. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../../Cloud/ght_api_tokens.htm#understanding-permissions">Undestanding API Token Permissions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
