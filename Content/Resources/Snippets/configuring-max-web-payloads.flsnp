        <p>SMF messages that are sent to a consuming Web client are contained within a Web transport message that the event broker sends in its HTTP response to that client. Each Web transport message that is sent can contain multiple SMF messages or partial SMF messages.</p>
        <p>The maximum Web payload value sets the maximum number of bytes allowed in a single Web transport message (not including the header). This value determines the number of SMF messages that can be sent in a single HTTP response and the size of the Web transport message sent in the HTTP response.</p>
        <p class="Note">Large SMF messages can be fragmented across Web transport messages to respect the value set for the maximum possible Web payload.</p>
