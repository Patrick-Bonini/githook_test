        <p>Transferring activity from one replication site to another can occur through either a controlled or uncontrolled failover. The differences are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <i>controlled failover</i> occurs when activity is transferred from one replication site to its mate replication site in a planned manner for operational reasons. When you successfully follow the controlled failover procedure, no messages are lost, regardless of the replication mode of the messages.</li>
            <li>An <i>uncontrolled failover</i> occurs due to a sudden loss of connectivity to a replication site with Message VPNs with a replication-active status. When this occurs, only synchronous replication mode messages are guaranteed not to be lost. Messages remaining in the replication queue are not available at the Failed site.</li>
        </ul>
