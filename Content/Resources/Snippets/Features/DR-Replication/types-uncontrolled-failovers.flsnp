    <p>There are three types of uncontrolled failovers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Short -Term Outage</b>
        <p>The Active site is out-of-service or isolated for a short duration (for example, minutes or hours). The replication queue has enough capacity to store all replicated messages and transactions during the outage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Long-Term Outage</b>
        <p>The Active site is out-of-service or isolated for a long duration (for example, days or weeks). The replication queue does not have enough capacity to store all replicated messages and transactions during the outage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Complete Failure</b>
        <p>The Active site goes out of service and cannot be recovered. AÂ critical component (the event broker, region connectivity, etc.) has been lost, or data on the external disk has been lost.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
