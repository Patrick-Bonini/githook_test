        <p>In the event of a failure at the active replication site, a network operator can change the replication state of the Message VPNs on event brokers at the standby replication site from standby to active. The messaging clients can then reconnect to the Message VPNs of the same name on the newly active replication site, and the processing of guaranteed messages and transactions can continue.</p>
        <p>There is a small possibility that under high traffic rates or unfortunate timing of a failover to the standby site, some messages could be duplicated following a failover. It is recommended that applications that cannot tolerate duplicate message delivery under any scenario should implement application-layer mechanisms (for example, globally-unique message IDs) to detect duplicate message delivery. Alternatively, if the application maintains a history of the replication group message IDs the application has processed, the replication group message ID&#160;of received messages can be compared to the replication group message ID&#160;of messages already processed. </p>
        <p>When using transactions (local and XA), not all transaction states on the active site are mirrored on the replication standby site. Only those states that are necessary to preserve the transactional behaviors on a failover are preserved. For example, XA transactions in the ACTIVE state are not mirrored. In the event of a replication failover, an application server transaction manager is expected to detect this and will handle it properly.</p>
