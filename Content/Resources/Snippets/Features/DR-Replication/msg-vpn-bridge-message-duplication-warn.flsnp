        <div class="Warning">
            <p>When configuring a bi-directional Message VPN bridge in a Message VPN where replication is also enabled,  avoid subscribing both ends of that bridge to the same topics if those topics are also configured for replication. This restriction also applies to overlapping wildcard subscriptions. In other words, it applies to any subscription which would match a message received over the bridge. If such topics exist, then following a replication failover, they can cause messages originally received over the bridge to be sent back over that bridge to the originating event broker. This  results in message duplication in the originating broker.</p>
