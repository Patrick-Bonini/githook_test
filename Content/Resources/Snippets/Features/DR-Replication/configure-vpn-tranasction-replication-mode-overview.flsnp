    <p>The transaction replication mode controls whether transactions are replicated synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous transactions wait for the transaction to complete on the standby site, while asynchronous transactions only wait of the transaction to be stored on the replication queue of the active site. Asynchronous transactions provide better performance, but they allow for message duplication in some failover scenarios. It is also possible to lose messages or transactions in replication queue in the event of non-recoverable failure of the active site.</p>
