        <h4>Using High Availability</h4>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only" /> event brokers in a high-availability (HA) group should have their clocks synchronized with a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"> (PTP can also be used by appliances)</MadCap:conditionalText> for Guaranteed message expiry to work as expected in redundant configurations. If the backup event broker does not have the same clock time as the primary, then the message will not expire at the expected time if there is a failover between when the message is published and when it is set to expire. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SAPTempHide">NTP server parameters can be configured from the CLI through the <code>ntp-server</code> CONFIG command.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h4>Using Replication</h4>
        <p>If you're using replication, and ACK&#160;propagation is enabled for the endpoint (enabled is the default value), replicated messages on the standby site that exceed their TTLs will be discarded rather than moved to a DMQ. If you disable ack propagation, then the TTL timers will run independently at both sites and lead to differences between the messages spooled at each site. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" />recommends that you don't disable ACK&#160;propagation.</p>
