        <p>Message replay is intended to be used for Guaranteed messages. Direct messages that aren't promoted to Guaranteed are not logged. Therefore, if there's a possibility that your messages might need to be replayed, they should be published as Guaranteed messages. </p>
        <p class="Caution">Be careful when promoting Direct messages because it can dramatically affect the event broker's performance and if the event broker's Guaranteed message budget is exceeded, the Direct messages are not logged. If you have Direct messages that you want to record in the replay log, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName" /> recommends changing the publisher to use Guaranteed messages. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SAPTempHide">For more information about message promotion and the associated risks, see <span href="../../../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Topic-Matching-and-Delivery-Modes.htm">Topic Matching and Message Delivery Modes</span></MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
