    <p>This connector does not support asynchronous publishing. Publish acknowledgments are resolved synchronously for all workflows regardless of the configuration option that you set: </p>
    <pre xml:space="preserve">&lt;workflow-id&gt; : The workflow ID ([0-19])
solace.connector.workflows.&lt;workflow-id&gt;.acknowledgment.publish-async=(true|false)</pre>
    <p class="Caution">Enabling <code>publish-async</code> will enable asynchronous publishing on the connector’s core but the effective publishing mode is still synchronous due to a lack of support on either the consumer binding or the producer binding.</p>
