        <p>Client profiles are objects provisioned on Message VPNs that are used to assign a common set of configuration properties to clients that have been successfully authorized.</p>
        <p>Client profiles control many client behaviors and capabilities. For example, client profiles control the allocation of resources, such as the maximum number of subscriptions permitted for a single client and the per-client transport queues. Other characteristics controlled by client profiles include tuning TCP connection parameters, enabling persistent messaging capabilities, and adjusting the point at which certain events are triggered.</p>
        <p>Client profiles can be applied to multiple client usernames or LDAP authorization groups in a Message VPN. This enables administrators to manage large groups of clients by making a configuration change once and having it apply to many clients rather than having to make individual changes to each client.</p>
        <p>If you do not assign specific client profiles to a client username account, then the system assigns a <code>default</code> client profile automatically to each client username account. You can customize the configuration of the <code>default</code> client profile, but you cannot delete it from the event broker.</p>
