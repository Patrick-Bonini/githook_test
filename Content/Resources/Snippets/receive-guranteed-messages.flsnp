        <p>To receive published Guaranteed messages (that is, messages that have a delivery mode of Persistent or Non&#8209;Persistent), a client must create a consumer Flow to bind to a Queue endpoint or a Topic Endpoint provisioned on the event broker. Once the client is bound to the endpoint, it can receive published Guaranteed messages that are delivered and spooled to that endpoint.</p>
        <p>When a consuming client successfully receives a Guaranteed message over a Flow, a corresponding application acknowledgment is required to indicate to the event broker that the client application received the message, and then the message can be removed from the endpoint.</p>
