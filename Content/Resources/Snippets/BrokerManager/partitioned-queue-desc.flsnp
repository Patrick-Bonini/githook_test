    <p>A partitioned queue consists of a parent non-exclusive queue, along with a child queue for each partition. For example, a partitioned queue with four partitions consists of a single non-exclusive parent queue and four additional child queues.  </p>
    <p>The parent queue holds the configuration state of the partitioned queue, including the subscription set and the combined message quota of the partitions. The parent queue does not retain messages and does not consume any quota. The partitions (child queues) are completely hidden from publishing and consuming applications. Partitions are neither directly accessible nor directly configurable.</p>
