        <p>Partition scaling refers to adding partitions to or removing partitions from a partitioned queue. Partition scaling is triggered when the administrator changes the partition count of the queue.</p>
        <p>When the partition count is decreased, the event broker removes extra partitions in the reverse order in which they were created (that is, the highest number partition is removed first). Any messages remaining in deleted partitions are also deleted.</p>
        <p>When the partition count is increased, the event broker assigns each new partition the next highest partition number in the sequence.</p>
        <p>Partition scaling triggers the <MadCap:xref href="../../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Partition-Rebalancing.htm">Partition Rebalancing</MadCap:xref> process on the event broker.  The implications of <MadCap:xref href="../../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Partition-Handoff.htm">Partition Handoff</MadCap:xref> apply to partition scaling as well.</p>
        <p>It may be preferable to move some messaging load to an alternate partitioned queue or to provision a new partitioned queue with more partitions, rather than changing the configuration of an existing partitioned queue.</p>
