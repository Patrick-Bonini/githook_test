        <p style="text-decoration: none;">If you change a queue from partitioned to non-partitioned or vice versa, the event broker unbinds all clients already bound to the queue. This ensures that the event broker and clients are consistently using (or not using) the semantics for partitioned queues. Note that any messages remaining in removed partitions are also removed.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: none;">If you change a queue from non-partitioned to partitioned, messages that are enqueued at the time of the change may get stuck because the event broker no longer delivers messages from the parent queue after the queue becomes partitioned. In this case, you can copy messages out of the parent queue.</p>
