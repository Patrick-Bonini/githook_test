    <p class="Note">On MacOS Big Sur and later, port 55555 (the default SMF port for the software event broker) is blocked. If this port is mapped to a port on a Docker container, the container fails to start, either silently or with a "port in use" error. To avoid this problem, the compose template maps port 55554 on the host to port 55555 in the container.</p>
