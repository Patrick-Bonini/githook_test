        <p class="Caution">If you are using software event brokers in a high-availability group, and your volumes use NVMe drivers, we strongly recommend that you set <code>nvme_core.io_timeout</code> to 30 seconds. Using a different setting can slow down or even prevent failover to the backup event broker in the event that the active event broker encounters  a problem accessing a volume.</p>
