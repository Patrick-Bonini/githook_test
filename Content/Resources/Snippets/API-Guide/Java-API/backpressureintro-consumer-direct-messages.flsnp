        <p>When subscribing to direct messages,  the Java API uses an internal buffer to store the messages that were received from the event broker. In ideal conditions, as soon as a message is received, the application processes the message. Depending on the processing speed and other factors, it's possible to receive messages faster than the subscribing application can process them (for example a high-volume burst of messages).  If the messages are not processed and allowed to accumulate, the internal buffer can reach its capacity, which is referred to as <i>back-pressure</i>.</p>
