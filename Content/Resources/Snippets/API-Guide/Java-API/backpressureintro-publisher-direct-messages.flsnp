        <p>When you use direct messaging, the messages are sent to a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only" /> event broker using a topic. The event broker relays the messages  to any consumers subscribed to topic for that message.</p>
        <p>At the time the client application publishes a direct message,  the API  queues the message in an internal buffer before it is  sent to event broker. In ideal conditions, as soon the application publishes a message, the API sends that message to the network, and that message is eventually received by  event broker. Depending on the network connectivity or other factors, it's possible for the client application to publish messages faster than the API can send them to the broker due to network  congestion or connectivity issues. This delay can cause the internal buffer to accumulate messages until it reaches its capacity,  preventing the API from storing any more messages. This scenario is referred to as <i>back-pressure</i>. It is important to configure your program to handle situations where back-pressure occurs.</p>
