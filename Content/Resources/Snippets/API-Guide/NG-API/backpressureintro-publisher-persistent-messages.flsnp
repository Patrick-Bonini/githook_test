    <p>When you use persistent messaging, the messages are sent to the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> event broker with a topic and may be enqueued on any queue with a matching topic subscription. The event broker then delivers the messages asynchronously to any consumers subscribed to that queue. At the time the client application publishes the persistent message,  the API  queues the message in an internal buffer before it is  sent to the event broker. In ideal conditions, as soon the application publishes a message, the API sends that message to the network, and that message is eventually received by  event broker. It is possible for the client application to publish messages more quickly than the API can send them to the broker due to network  congestion or connectivity issues. This delay can cause the internal buffer to accumulate messages until it reaches its capacity,  preventing the API from storing any more messages. This scenario is referred to as <i>back-pressure</i>. It is important to configure your application to handle situations where back-pressure occurs.</p>
