        <p>The default configuration for this API is  to use an unlimited sized internal buffer for messages. This configuration is not suitable for memory restrictive environments because the buffer is allowed to grow indefinitely, and it can cause out-of-memory errors (or potentially  undefined errors).  This configuration is useful when your infrastructure is made up of several microservices which are short-lived. Use of this configuration is also useful because you don't have to write code to handle back-pressure scenarios. </p>
