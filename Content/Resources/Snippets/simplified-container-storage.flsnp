    <p class="Note">In versions of SolOS prior to 9.12, the <code>storage-elements</code> were typically externalized to separate storage volumes and mounted to the container using multiple mount points. In version 9.12 and later, the <code>storage-group</code> is now mapped to a single mount point. For details about how to convert from <code>storage-elements</code> to the single <code>storage-group</code>, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../Software-Broker/Convert-to-Single-Storage-Element.htm">Converting from Multiple Mount Points to a Single Mount Point.</MadCap:xref></p>
