    <p>With SolOS version 9.13.1 or later, you can do a <b>90-day evaluation</b> of the Enterprise edition by installing the Standard edition and entering a free product key. To get the product key, go to  <a href="https://solace.com/downloads/" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">solace.com/downloads</a> and select <b>PubSub+ Enterprise Evaluation</b>.</p>
    <div class="Note">
