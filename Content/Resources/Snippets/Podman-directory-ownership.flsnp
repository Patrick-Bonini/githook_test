    <p class="Note">Podman resets the ownership of directories and files in volume mounts when it starts the rootless container for the first time, therefore, simply run the <code>podman unshare</code> command after you start the container for the first time. Alternatively, create an empty directory and bind mount itâ€”in this case the correct directory/file ownership is automatically assigned.</p>
