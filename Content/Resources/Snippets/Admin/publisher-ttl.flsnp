        <p>Messages can also have a publisher-supplied TTL, which indicates how long the publisher considers a message to be valid. This differs from the maximum TTL for the queue in that the publisher TTL expiration starts when a message is published and counts down as the message passes through the network. If a message has both a publisher-assigned TTL and a queue-assigned maximum TTL, the  event broker uses the minimum of the two TTL values when the message is in the queue.</p>
