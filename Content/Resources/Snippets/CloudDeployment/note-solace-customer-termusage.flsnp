    <p class="Note">Certain deployment operations must be performed by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>, whereas others may be performed by the customer. In addition, different deployment options refer to infrastructure or other resources belonging to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> and/or the customer. To prevent confusion, we sometimes explicitly use the terms "<MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>" and "the customer" in discussions of infrastructure and installation procedures. </p>
