    <p>The number of services that can be created in a datacenter is based on the size of the subnet, which is based on the subnet prefix. An <i>n</i>-bit subnet prefix leaves 32 − <i>n</i> address bits available, meaning that 2<sup>32 − n</sup> IPv4 addresses match  subnet mask with a given <i>n</i>-bit prefix. For example, if a subnet has a CIDR of 10.0.0.0/24, it has a 24-bit prefix, which means there are 2<sup>32 − 24</sup> = 2<sup>8</sup> or 256 hosts available.</p>
