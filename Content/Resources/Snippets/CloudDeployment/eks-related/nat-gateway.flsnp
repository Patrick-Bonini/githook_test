        <p>You require one Elastic IP (EIP) for each NAT gateway for your cluster. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"></MadCap:variable> recommends that you have two Elastic IPs (and two NAT gateways) for a production system. </p>
        <p>You can have up to three EIPSs and NAT gateways, which allows you to have multi-AZ NAT redundancy . This requires that you have three EIPs. These NAT EIPs must be created upfront. If you use a Terafom module, ensure you use the EIPs.</p>
