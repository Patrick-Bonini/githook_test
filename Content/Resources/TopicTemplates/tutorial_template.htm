    <h1>Tutorial</h1>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">The title should have the form <b>&lt;Gerund&gt;&lt;Pronoun&gt;&lt;Object/Result&gt;</b>. For example, "Creating an Event Broker Service" or "Cataloging a Schema".</p>

    </ul>
    <h4 MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Mission of Tutorials</h4>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Tutorials are helpful to users because they typically take users through full scenarios rather than just focusing on a single, isolated task. The scenario in a tutorial might not address an exact user’s situation, but there’s a lot of value in seeing the big picture and understanding how all the pieces fit together.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Tutorials are step by step guides aimed at a very diverse audience. To provide a good learning experience, a consistent and didactic approach is key.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">A good tutorial should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">be focused on one topic or a very small group of related topics. Keep it simple and on point as people who want to learn multiple subjects will take multiple tutorials.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">produce a tangible result. The topic is demonstrated with a <em>small practical project</em> and not only a theoretical or "hello world" example. The tutorial reader will come out of it with a working example on their environment.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">be short. An estimated 60 minutes for a tutorial is an absolute maximum. Most tutorials should be in the range of 15 - 30 minutes.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">be divided in short steps. Each step is practical and results in user-visible progress.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">be entertaining! Try to have a fun project to work on, even if it’s something impractical!</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Tone</h4>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">The tone of your tutorial should be friendly. Try to make the reader feel that they’re building and learning something together with you.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">All tutorials should have the same tone, regardless of the topic. </p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">In short, this isn’t a teacher/student paradigm, but rather friends sharing some time together. Thus, "<strong>we</strong>" should be used as much as possible, like "<strong>we have just seen</strong>", "<strong>we now understand that…</strong>". However, "<strong>you</strong>" can be used for demonstrating things in the user’s context, like: "<strong>edit your file</strong>", "<strong>your directory should look like this</strong>", "<strong>on your system</strong>", etc.</p>
    <h4 MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Sections</h4>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Tutorials generally include the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Introduction or summary—Comprised of the paragraph(s) immediately following the main title. <b>Do not use another title like Introduction or similar</b>. This section explains the use case or end goal (what program or system are you building; what feature are you configuring, etc), and describes what success looks like. It also  provides a list of the main steps the tutorial is going to illustrate. The list items should be links (anchors) using the  use the <code>devlinks</code> class so you can change the link text if necessary to fit the flow better.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Prerequisites—Use the title "<b>Before You Begin</b>". This section describes what you'll need (prerequisites) for completing the tutorial, including tools and concepts to understand.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Tasks—One or more sections with the list of instructions to complete a task. For each section, use a title of the form <b>&lt;Imperative&gt;&lt;Object&gt;</b> (for example, "Establish a Connection", "Search for an Event"). The steps should be as short as possible.  Aim to do the fewest steps necessary to accomplish  the task. Omit steps that aren't strictly necessary, but include a link to related documentation. Try to keep to 10 steps or fewer. If required, break up the tutorial into a multiple sections or even multiple tutorials. Use screen shots and animated GIFs to show steps and orient the user. Always include a sentence (or more) at the end of the steps that describes what was built or shows how to confirm success.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Conclusion—Use the title "<b>Next Steps</b>". After all tasks have been completed; this section briefly recaps what the tutorial illustrated, and what the reader can do next.</li>
    </ul>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">This concludes the introductory instructions. Delete this line and everything above it, except for the main (h1) title.</p>
