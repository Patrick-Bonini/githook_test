    <h1>Task</h1>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Task topics answer "How do I?" questions. They use a well-defined structure
				that describes how to accomplish a specific goal by completing a procedure. A
				task topic contains a single procedure, which is made up of a
				series of steps. Each step describes a single action or command for the user to
			take. A step can also describe the step results.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">One or more task topics typically follow each concept topic.</p>
    <h4 MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Structuring a Task Topic</h4>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">At a minimum, a task topic includes the following components.</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">A title. The preferred phrasing is a gerund acting on a single
						noun. Examples include "Adding a Team Member", "Creating an Email Message",
					and "Placing an Order".</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Context. This paragraph is the value proposition for the topic. It presents
						information about why the user would complete this task in terms of a
						business or personal goal, and not in terms of the software application. The
					preferred phrasing is, "To  &lt;complete business goal&gt;, follow these steps."</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Two or more task steps, presented in an ordered list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">A task topic can also include the following additional information.</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">A brief description. This might be added between the title and the context
					statement.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Prerequisites. If a task has one or more prerequisites, such as use of a
						third party tool or access with an admin password, list them before step 1 of
					the procedure.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">The result of the task. Providing the expected result of a procedure is
						helpful to users, especially when the steps are complex, there are multiple
						results such as status messages that occur over time, or users have several
					choices for what to do next.</li>
    </ul>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Typically, a task topic is added after a concept topic, so its title is a
			second level heading or lower.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">For more information about concept topics, see the Concept template.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">This concludes the introductory instructions. Delete this line and everything above it, except for the main (h1) title.</p>
    <h3>&lt;Title of the form <i>Gerund article Noun</i>&gt;</h3>

    <p>&lt;Before you begin this task, complete this list of prerequisites.&gt;</p>
    <p>To &lt;provide the context for completing the task&gt;, follow these steps.</p>
