    <h1>Concept</h1>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">This template uses ideas from the <a href="https://draft-edx-style-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">edX style guide</a>.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Concept topics answer “Why?” and What is…?” questions. Concept topics build
				on existing audience knowledge to provide general explanations, background
			information, and examples to help the reader understand a feature or task.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Concept topics explain abstract ideas and introduce terminology. Concept
				topics tend to be relatively unaffected by feature enhancements over time:
				while additions might be needed to support new options and their use cases,
			they tend to require less rewriting than task topics.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Concept topics are typically followed by at least one task topic. When they
				introduce complex features, they can be followed by a set of additional concept
			topics and related task topics.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">This template is a Concept topic. About Concept topics. Whoa.</p>
    <h4 MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Structuring a Concept Topic</h4>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">At a minimum, a concept topic includes the following components.</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">A title, often phrased as a gerund (but don't use a gerund if it doesn't add anything to the title. For example, "Understanding Message VPNs" could just as well be simply "Message VPNs").</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">One or more body paragraphs that answer the following questions (not exhaustive):<ul><li>What is &lt;feature/object/setting&gt;?</li><li>Why would I use it?</li><li>When would I use it?</li><li>What kind of thing is it (that is, does it belong to or inherit properties from another thing)?</li><li>What do I need to have built or configured before using this &lt;feature/object/setting&gt;?</li><li>Under what circumstances would I not want to use this &lt;feature/object/setting&gt;?</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">It can also include the following additional structured information.</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">One or more examples.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">Two or more subsections, marked by subheadings.</li>
      <li MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">A list of related topics.</li>
    </ul>
