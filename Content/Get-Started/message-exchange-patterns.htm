    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud;Appliance;Software"/>Message Exchange Patterns</h1>
    <p>
		Most messaging applications use  the following messaging exchange patterns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <MadCap:xref href="#Publish-">Publish-Subscribe</MadCap:xref>
      </li>
      <li>
        <MadCap:xref href="#Point-to">Point-to-Point</MadCap:xref>
      </li>
      <li>
        <MadCap:xref href="#Request-">Request-Reply</MadCap:xref>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Events generally use the publish-subscribe model.</p>
    <p>Queries and commands use the point-to-point or request-reply model.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Publish-"/>Publish-Subscribe</h2>
    <p>With publish-subscribe messaging, messages sent by the producer (publisher) can be processed multiple times by different consumers (subscribers). Each consumer receives its own copy of the message for processing.</p>

    </p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Point-to"/>Point-to-Point</h2>
    <p>With point-to-point messaging, messages sent by the producer are processed by a single consumer.</p>

    </p>
    <h3><a name="Non-Excl"/>Non-Exclusive Consumption</h3>
    <p>You can use consumer groups to extend traditional point-to-point messaging. Consumer groups enable multiple consumers to share a queue, which is used as a single channel for messages from the producer. The receiving application can have multiple consumers, but each message is still only delivered to a single endpoint.</p>

    </p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Request-"/>Request-Reply</h2>
    <p>With request-reply messaging, applications achieve two-way communication using separate point-to-point channels: one for requests, and another for replies.</p>
