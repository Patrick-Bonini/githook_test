      <dt>Event</dt>
      <dd>An event represents a business moment, action, or occurrence that can be communicated to interested applications. Within your EDA, “event” also refers to the message that communicates the occurrence.</dd>
      <dd>When designing your EDA in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/>, an event is the object that specifies the type of moment or action that occurs and the contents of the metadata that describes and categorizes the event in the message that is sent.
