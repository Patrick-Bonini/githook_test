    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud;Appliance;Software"/>What Are Event Brokers?</h1>
    <p>An event broker is middleware that mediates the communication of event messages between producers and consumers  using the various message exchange patterns. Event-driven architecture (EDA) uses  event brokers to provide the messaging infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Applications that produce and consume events are clients of an event broker. When an application publishes an event message, the event is sent to an event broker, which then routes the event on to subscribing clients.</p>
