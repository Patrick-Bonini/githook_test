    <h1>Message VPNs</h1>
    <p>Message VPNs allow for many separate applications to share a single Solace PubSub+ software or appliance event broker while still remaining independent and separated. Basically, Message VPNs enable the virtualization of an event broker into many individual virtual event brokers.</p>
    <p>Message VPNs allow for the segregation of topic space and messaging space by creating fully separate messaging domains. Message VPNs also group clients connecting to a network of Solace PubSub+ event brokers so that messages published within a particular group are only visible to clients that belong to that group. Each client connection is associated with a single Message VPN.</p>
    <p class="Note"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s have only a single message VPN. <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> allows you to quickly create multiple <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to segregate topics and client applications.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Default"/>Default  Configuration</h2>
    <p>The initial configuration of a Solace PubSub+ event broker with respect to the Message VPN feature is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a single Message VPN named <code>default</code>. It can't be deleted from the event broker.<ul><li><u>For Solace PubSub+ appliances</u>: the  Message VPN named <code>default</code> is disabled by default. </li><li><u>For Solace PubSub+ software event brokers</u>: the  Message VPN named <code>default</code> is enabled.</li></ul></li>
      <li>There is a single client username named <code>default</code> that exists in each Message VPN. It has default attributes assigned to it, and it's assigned to all clients. It can't be deleted from the event broker, but you can modify its configuration.<ul><li><u>For Solace PubSub+ appliances</u>: the  client username named <code>default</code> is disabled by default.
			</li><li><u>For Solace PubSub+ software event brokers</u>: the client username named <code>default</code> is enabled by default.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
