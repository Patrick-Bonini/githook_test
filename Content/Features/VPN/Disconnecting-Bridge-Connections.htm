    <h1>Disconnecting Bridge Connections</h1>
    <p>You can disconnect a bridge from either the local or remote Message VPN, which causes the TCP connection for the bridge to be disconnected. The disconnected bridge immediately attempts to reconnect, starting at the first remote Message VPN in its configured list.</p>
    <p>To disconnect a Message VPN bridge and its clients from the Solace PubSub+ appliance, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter the following command:<p class="Code">solace# admin<br/>solace(admin)# bridge &lt;bridge-name-pattern&gt; message-vpn &lt;vpn-name&gt; [primary | backup]</p><p><u>Where</u>:</p><p><code>&lt;bridge-name-pattern&gt;</code> is the Message VPN bridge name. This can be its full name or part of its name when wildcard characters are used.</p><p><code>&lt;vpn-name&gt;</code> is the name of an existing Message VPN that the bridge belongs to. This can be its full name or part of its name when wildcard characters are used.</p><p><code>primary</code> indicates only bridges of the primary virtual router</p><p><code>backup</code> indicates only bridges of the backup virtual router</p></li>
      <li>Enter the following command:      <p class="Code">solace(admin/bridge)# disconnect</p></li>
    </ol>
