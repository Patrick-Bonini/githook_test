    <h1>Clearing Subscriptions from Offline Event Brokers</h1>
    <p>If a Solace PubSub+ event broker is removed from an MNR network for any reason, or if its IP address is changed while it has active subscriptions, that event broker and its subscriptions remain in the SMRP database for 30 minutes, after which they are automatically removed.</p>
    <p>However, if you want to force the removal at anytime prior to timeout, use the following Admin EXEC command :</p>
    <p class="Code">solace&gt; admin<br/>solace(admin)# delete-remote-router &lt;router-name&gt;<br/></p>
    <p><u>Where</u>:<br/></p>
    <p><code>&lt;router-name&gt;</code> is the full name of the remote offline event broker, or part of the event broker name with the wildcard character <code>?</code> used to represent one character of the name, or the wildcard character <code>*</code> used to represent zero or more characters of the name.</p>
