    <p>A Solace PubSub+ 3230 must be installed in a four-post 19 in. rack or cabinet. Four‑post mounting is required due to the weight of the appliance. </p>
    <p>One rack kit is supplied with a Solace PubSub+ 3230 in the shipping crate. This rack kit is required to install the appliance in a four-post 19 in. rack. Each rack kit contains two inner rails and two slide assemblies that can adjust to fit vertical rail racks from 22.5 to 38 in. deep.</p>
