    <p>Only four-post mounting is to be used for a Solace PubSub+ 3230 due to its weight.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">Due to the size and weight of the appliance, never attempt to install the appliance in the rack by yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <p>   </p>
    <div class="Warning">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> Never pull more than one component out of the rack on its slide assemblies at one time. The weight of more than one extended component could cause the rack to tip over and injure someone.</p>
    </div>
    <p>   </p>
    <div class="Note">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">Ensure that you have suitable fasteners to secure the appliance to the rack. These are not provided with the appliance..</p>
    </div>

    <ol>
      <li>Pull the two interior slide assemblies so that they extend out from the rack.</li>
      <li>Lift the appliance into position in front of the extended slides.</li>
      <li>Align the inner rails you mounted on the side of the chassis with the open portion of the slide assemblies.</li>
      <li>Push the appliance into the slide assemblies until the appliance stops.</li>
      <li>Secure the appliance’s mounting-bracket flanges to the rack with suitable fasteners (not provided). Fully tighten the fasteners.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">Ensure that ventilation holes are not obstructed. Leave enough space around the appliance for adequate ventilation or equipment damage can occur.</p>
