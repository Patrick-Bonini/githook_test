    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 1: Install the Slides and Rails</h1>
    <p>Perform the following steps to install the rails and slide assemblies found in the provided rack kit:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To install the inner rails to the sides of the appliance chassis, perform the following steps: <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Extend the inner rail from a slide assembly until the plastic release latch is visible.</li><li>Push down on the plastic release latch while pulling on the inner rail to remove it from the slide assembly (as show below).
        <p class="GraphicCaption">Removing the Inner Rail from the Slide Assembly</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3230-Hardware-Installation/4_31.jpg" style="max-width: 400px;" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 400px; }" alt=""/></p></li></ol></li>
      <li>Attach the inner rails to both sides of the appliance chassis, with the open end of the rails at the back of the appliance. The position of the rails and how they are attached depends on the chassis version used by the appliance.
        <p>For a CHS-3230AC-02 chassis, use a No. 2 Phillips screwdriver to fully tighten the provided #6 screws (four screws per side) in the positions shown below.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Rail Screw Positions for CHS-3230AC-02 Chassis</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3230-Hardware-Installation/4_1.jpg" style="width: 510.9965px;height: 118.4678px;" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>To install the slide assemblies in the four-post 19 in. rack, perform the following steps for both slide assemblies:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Using a tape measure, measure the outer distance between the front and rear rack rails.</li><li>Reposition the inner sliders to access the heads of the bolts that secure the rear mounting brackets to the outer rail of the slide assembly. If additional length is needed, you may also need to access the bolts that secure the front mounting brackets.</li><li>The figure below shows how the inner slide assembly can be repositioned so that both bolt heads for the front and rear mounting brackets are accessible.</li></ol><p class="GraphicCaption">Accessing Mounting Bracket Bolt Heads</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3230-Hardware-Installation/4_2.jpg" style="width: 482.6669px;height: 219.1258px;" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>Use a No. 2 Phillips screwdriver and an adjustable wrench to loosen the bolts holding the rear mounting bracket, and slide the mounting bracket to a position that provides the correct length.
        <p>If additional length is required, remove and reposition the rear mounting bracket to further lengthen the slide assembly.</p></li>
      <li>Fully tighten the mounting-bracket bolts. The slide assembly should fit snugly in the rack.
			<p>In the following picture, the standard configuration of the front mounting bracket is shown at top. For extra deep racks, you can reposition both the front and rear mounting brackets—the bottom slide assembly shows an extended configuration. The required positioning of the bolts for each configuration is highlighted.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Sample Bracket Positions</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3230-Hardware-Installation/4_38.jpg" style="width: 432px;height: 82.08px;" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>To install the adjusted slide assemblies in the rack, perform the following steps for both slide assemblies:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>A Solace PubSub+ 3230 requires 2U (3.5 inches) of vertical space rack space. To visibly indicate where the appliance’s 2U space will be located, use a felt-tipped marker or pieces of masking tape to indicate on the rack’s front vertical rails where the upper and lower edges of the appliance’s 2U space. </li><li>Properly position the slide assemblies in the marked out 2U space.<p>For a CHS-3230AC-02 chassis, position one of the slide assemblies so that its mounting-bracket flange is at the bottom rack unit space of the system’s 2U space.</p></li><li>Secure the front and rear mounting-bracket flange with the required fasteners (not provided) in the vertical rails and fully tighten.</li><p class="SWSubstepResultLineNHS">For proper operation, the mounting brackets for both slide assemblies must be set in the same positions, and they must be level in the rack.</p></ol></li>
