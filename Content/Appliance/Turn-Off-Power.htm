    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Powering an Appliance Up or Down</h1>
    <p>To shut down a Solace PubSub+ appliance, and not have it automatically restart after shut down, use the <code>power-down</code>  command.</p>
    <p>It's also possible to remotely power on Solace PubSub+ appliances using Wake On LAN  (refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:general_router_admin_tasks_2612439345_91392" href="#Turn_Off_WOL">Powering Up Appliances With WOL</MadCap:xref> for details).</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p>Powering down an appliance causes a disruption in customer service. Notify the appropriate personnel to ensure that all traffic to and from appliances is stopped before powering down.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To power down to an appliance, enter the following commands:</p>
    <p class="Code">solace&gt; enable<br/>solace# power-down</p>
    <p>The appliance will shut down and power will be turned off.</p>
    <p class="Note">After powering down an appliance, press the (<img src="../Resources/Images/Appliance/standby_button.png" style="width: 14.39904px;height: 16.79904px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt=""/>) on/standby button to power it back up. Depending on the type of appliance, the on/standby button is located on either the appliance's  rear panel or  front panel  (in this case, use a paper clip to press the on/standby button). <br/>You may also use Wake On LAN (WOL) to turn power back on to the appliance (refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:general_router_admin_tasks_2612439345_91392" href="#Turn_Off_WOL">Powering Up Appliances With WOL</MadCap:xref> for details).</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Turn_Off_WOL"/>Powering Up an Appliance With WOL</h2>
    <p>Wake On LAN (WOL) is an Ethernet networking standard that allows a machine to be turned on or woken up remotely by a network message. Appliances are WOL‑compliant.</p>
    <p>To generate valid Magic Packets for use with appliances, you must obtain a commercial third-party WOL tool and the target appliance’s management port MAC address.</p>
    <p>When power is turned off to an appliance by the <code>power-down</code> Privileged EXEC command, the Ethernet card on the event broker motherboard remains powered, and listens to the network over the configured management port (either eth1 or eth2 on Solace PubSub+ 3260, 3530, and 3560, eth0 or eth1 on Solace PubSub+ 3230s, or chassis/lag1, as applicable) for a specific packet, called the Magic Packet (the management port only listens and does not reply).</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p>Pressing the (<img src="../Resources/Images/Appliance/standby_button.png" style="width: 14.39904px;height: 16.79904px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt=""/>) on/standby button on a Solace PubSub+ appliance turns power to the appliance off and disables WOL. To use WOL, you must turn off power through the <code>power-down</code> Privileged EXEC command only.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The Magic Packet is a digital data transmission unit containing anywhere within its payload six bytes of ones (that is, hexadecimal <code>FF FF FF FF FF FF</code>), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target appliance’s management port Media Access Control (MAC) Address. </p>
    <p class="Note">The Magic Packet may be sent as a broadcast packet over any network and transport layer protocol because it is only scanned for the string above and is not parsed.</p>
    <p>When the listening appliance receives a valid Magic Packet, the Ethernet card turns on the appliance to full power and starts the operating system.</p>
