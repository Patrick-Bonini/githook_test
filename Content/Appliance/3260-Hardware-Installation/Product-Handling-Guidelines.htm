    <h1>Product Handling Guidelines</h1>
    <p>This section provides detailed information on Solace product shipping, handling, and installation safety information.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Shipping">
            </a>Shipping and Handling Rules</h2>
    <p>Follow these general shipping and handling rules to avoid potentially hazardous situations or damage to the equipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not unpack Solace PubSub+ 3260s until you are ready to install them. Keep the chassis in the shipping container to prevent accidental damage until you have determined where you want it installed.</li>
      <li>Verify that all site preparations are complete prior to installation.</li>
      <li>Allow the equipment to sit for a minimum of one hour before proceeding with installation. Blades and subassemblies must be conditioned to room temperature for a minimum period of one hour prior to installation.</li>
      <li>Never attempt to lift an object that might be too heavy for one person. For example, the Solace PubSub+ 3260 equipment shelf weighs approximately 80 lbs (36 kg).</li>
      <li>Maintain a solid footing and ensure that equipment is situated between feet before lifting.</li>
      <li>Remove packing material from the area prior to handling.</li>
      <li>Secure any loose cabling to the equipment prior to handling.</li>
      <li>Never install equipment that appears damaged.</li>
      <li>Ensure that Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) precautions are taken when handling blades and sub-assemblies.</li>
      <li>Do not place blades on their top or bottom surfaces.</li>
      <li>Always handle blades by the faceplate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="product_handling_guidelines_4227583960_164024">
            </a>Product Safety Labels</h2>
    <p>Product safety labels warn service personnel of any potential hazards. To prevent personal injury, equipment damage, or service interruptions, follow all precautionary messages found on product safety labels and in the product documentation, as well as the safety procedures established by your company.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="product_handling_guidelines_4227583960_161931">
            </a>Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Rules</h2>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">To prevent equipment damage from electrostatic discharge, always ensure that the system chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an antistatic wrist strap, or another antistatic device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>ESD Prevention Rules</h3>
    <p>Take the following precautions to minimize the risk of damage from ESD:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always observe proper ESD handling techniques and use of personal grounding devices when working on shelves, blades, and cables connected to blades.</li>
      <li>Test the integrity of the ESD-preventative wrist or ankle strap daily. The resistance value should be between 1 and 10 megaohms.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the ESD-preventive strap makes contact with skin.</li>
      <li>Do not permit system components or blades to contact clothing. ESD protection is only effective for the body.</li>
      <li>Install system blades (as applicable) immediately after removal from the antistatic packaging. All Solace equipment is provided in antistatic packaging.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="product_handling_guidelines_4227583960_163078">
            </a>System Blade Rules</h2>
    <p>All Solace PubSub+ 3260 blades are subject to damage from rough handling or electrostatic discharge. </p>
    <h3>Blade Handling Rules</h3>
    <p>Follow these rules when handling Solace PubSub+ 3260 blades:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always observe proper ESD handling techniques and use of personal grounding devices before removing a blade from its package.</li>
      <li>Protect each blade that is not in active use on the shelf by storing each one separately in antistatic packaging.</li>
      <li>Handle each blade by the faceplate.</li>
      <li>Do not touch the solder side of the blade, pin connectors, or any exposed components.</li>
      <li>Do not stack blades on or against each other.</li>
      <li>Do not force blades into their packaging material.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Blade Installation (and Replacement) Rules</h3>
    <p>Follow these rules when installing or replacing Solace PubSub+ 3260 blades:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always observe proper ESD handling techniques and use of personal grounding devices when before installing a blade into the Fabric Expansion Cartridge (FEC).</li>
      <li>Blades must reach room temperature before being inserted in the FEC.</li>
      <li>Inspect all blades, including pin connectors and soldering, for damage before inserting into the FEC.</li>
      <li>Do not force a blade into a slot.</li>
      <li>Blades that have potentially hot surfaces can cause burns. Use caution when handling these blades.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Blade Storage Rules</h3>
    <p>Follow these rules to prevent damage to spare system blades while in storage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always leave blades in their original antistatic packaging and storage containers until you need them.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the ambient temperature of the equipment storage location never exceeds 50째C (122째F).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Following these blade storage rules prevents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>accumulation of dirt or dust on the blade pin connectors</li>
      <li>damage to the blade or its components</li>
      <li>warping of spare blades due to storage areas where the humidity can exceed 95 percent and the temperature can exceed 70째C (158째F).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Blade Transport Rules</h3>
    <p>When transporting Solace PubSub+ 3260 blades, pack each blade in its original antistatic-packaging, shielded container, and padding. If the original packaging material is not available, use another shielded container.</p>
