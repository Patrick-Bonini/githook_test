    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Rack-Mount Requirements</h1>
    <p>Only four-post mounting is to be used for the Solace PubSub+ 3260 due to the weight of the system.</p>
    <p>One rack kit is supplied with the appliance in the shipping crate. The rack kit is required for each system to be installed in a four-post 19 in. rack.</p>
    <p>The rack kit consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>two chassis mounting brackets with handles</li>
      <li>eight No. 8 Phillips screws to attach the mounting brackets</li>
      <li>eight No. 6 pan-head Phillips screws to attach the inner rails to the chassis</li>
      <li>a slide assembly hardware package. In this package there are two inner rails and two slide assemblies that can be adjusted for a rack depth of 22.5 to 38 in. These are required items.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">This package also contains four L brackets, ten M4 pan-head screws, and 16 M5 pan-head screws. These are extra items that could possibly be used to secure the slide assembly mounting-bracket flanges to the rack posts. If these items are not suitable for your rack posts, they can be discarded.</p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The rack rails must be spaced widely enough to accommodate the system chassis’s external dimensions: 7 in. (177.8 mm) high (that is, 4U), 17 in. (431.8mm) wide, and 31 in. (787.4 mm) deep.</li>
      <li>The rack must be strong enough to support the weight of the fully configured system, up to about 80 lb (36.3 kg). </li>
      <li>For service personnel to remove and install hardware components, there must be adequate space at the front and back of the system. Allow at least 2.5 feet (76.2 cm) both in front of and behind the system.</li>
      <li>The rack or cabinet must have an adequate supply of cooling air.</li>
      <li>In a closed cabinet, there must be a minimum of 6 in. (15.2 cm) of unobstructed airflow behind the system. Otherwise, airflow baffles must be installed to prevent recirculation of hot air and overheating.</li>
      <li>The system should be mounted at the bottom of the rack if it is the only unit in the rack.</li>
      <li>When mounting the system in a partially filled rack, load the rack from the bottom to the top with the heaviest component at the bottom of the rack. Load the heaviest item in the rack first.</li>
      <li>Make sure that the rack is level and stable before extending a component from the rack.</li>
      <li>Use caution when pressing the component rail release latches and sliding a component into or out of a rack; the slide rails can pinch your fingers.</li>
      <li>After a component is inserted into the rack, carefully extend the rail into a locking position and then slide the component into the rack.</li>
      <li>Allow 4U (7 inches) of vertical space for each 3260 appliance you install in the rack.</li>
    </ul>
