    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 3: Install Rack Kit</h1>
    <p>One rack kit is supplied with the Solace PubSub+ 3260 in the shipping crate to install the system in a four-post 19 in. rack (refer to <MadCap:xref href="Before-Installing-3260.htm#preparing_your_site_1325169260_75402">Rack Requirements</MadCap:xref>). A rack kit is required for each system to be installed in the rack.</p>
    <p>Perform the following steps to install the rack kit:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To attach the mounting brackets to the front of the system chassis, perform the following steps:</li>
      <li>Place the Solace PubSub+ 3260 on a flat surface with the front facing toward you.
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Locate one of the two mounting brackets and align it over the four threaded mounting holes on the front right-hand side of the system.</li><li>Secure the bracket to the system chassis using four of the provided flat-head No. 8 Phillips screws, and fully tighten using a No. 2 Phillips screwdriver.

      <li>To install the inner rails to the bottom sides of the system chassis, perform the following steps: 
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Extend the inner rail from a slide assembly until the plastic release latch is visible.</li><li>Push down on the plastic release latch while pulling on the inner rail to remove it from the slide assembly (as shown below).
        <p class="GraphicCaption">Removing the Inner Rail from the Slide Assembly</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/4_34.jpg" style="width: 465.9197px;height: 228.6931px;" alt=""/></p></li><li>Fasten the inner rails on both sides of the system chassis, at the bottom, with the open end of the rails towards the back of the chassis. The closed end of the rails should extend approximately two inches from the front of the chassis. Use a No. 2 Phillips screwdriver to fully tighten the provided No. 6 pan-head Phillips screws (four screws per side) in the positions shown below.</li></ol><p class="GraphicCaption">Securing the Inner Rails</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/4_31.jpg" style="width: 519px;height: 209.4359px;" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>To install the slide assemblies in the four-post 19 in. rack, perform the following steps for both slide assemblies. 
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Using a tape measure, measure the outer distance between the front and rear rack rails.</li><li>Reposition the inner sliders to access the heads of the bolts that secure the rear mounting brackets to the outer rail of the slide assembly. If additional length is needed, you may also need to access the bolts that secure the front mounting brackets.
			<p class="SWSubstepResultLineNHS">The figure below shows how the inner slide assembly can be repositioned so that both bolt heads for the front and rear mounting brackets are accessible.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Accessing Mounting Bracket Bolt Heads</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/4_1.jpg" style="width: 481.8605px;height: 232.4592px;" alt=""/></p></li><li>Use a No. 2 Phillips screwdriver and an adjustable wrench to loosen the bolts holding the rear mounting bracket, and slide the mounting bracket to a position that provides the correct length.
			<p class="SWSubstepResultLineNHS">If additional length is required, remove and reposition the rear mounting bracket to further lengthen the slide assembly.</p></li><li>Fully tighten the mounting-bracket bolts. The slide assembly should fit snugly in the rack.
        <p class="SWSubstepResultLineNHS">In the following picture, the standard configuration of the front mounting bracket is shown at top. The bottom slide assembly shows an extended configuration. The required positioning of the bolts for each configuration is highlighted.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Sample Bracket Positions</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/4_47.jpg" style="width: 508.2346px;height: 96.56352px;" alt=""/></p><p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">For extra deep racks, you can reposition both the front and rear mounting brackets.</p></li></ol></li>
      <li>To install the slide assemblies in the rack, perform the following steps:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Mark the rack’s front vertical rails with a felt-tipped marker or place masking tape where the upper and lower edges of the system’s 4U space will be located. </li><li>At the front of the rack, position one of the slide assemblies so that its mounting-bracket flange is at the bottom of the 1U space for the system’s 4U space.</li><li>Secure the front and rear mounting-bracket flange with the required screws (not provided) in the vertical rails and fully tighten. </li><li>Repeat these substeps for the remaining slide assembly on the other side of the rack.
        <p class="SWSubstepResultLineNHS">The following picture provides an example of properly installed slide assemblies in one common rack type. </p><p class="GraphicCaption">Slide Assemblies Installed in Rack </p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/rails_in_rack_scaled.png" style="width: 457.3085px;height: 221.6717px;margin-left: 5.99976px;margin-top: 5.99976px;margin-right: 5.999783px;margin-bottom: 6.000484px;" alt=""/></p></li></ol></li>
