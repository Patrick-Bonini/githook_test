    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 4: Install Chassis in the Rack</h1>
    <p>Only four-post mounting is to be used for a appliance due to the weight of the system.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">Due to the size and weight of the appliance, never attempt to install the appliance in the rack by yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <p>    </p>
    <div class="Warning">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">Never pull more than one component out of the rack on its slide assemblies at one time. The weight of more than one extended component could cause the rack to tip over and injure someone.</p>
    </div>
    <p>    </p>
    <div class="Note">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> Ensure that you have suitable fasteners to secure the appliance to the rack. These are not provided with the appliance.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To install the 3260 appliance chassis in the rack, perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pull the two interior slide assemblies so that they extend out from the rack.</li>
      <li>Using the handles located on the sides of the chassis, lift the system into position in front of the extended slides.</li>
      <li>Align the inner rails you mounted on the side of the chassis with the open portion of the slide assemblies.</li>
      <li>Push the system into the slide assemblies until the system stops.</li>
      <li>Secure the front of the mounting-bracket flanges with suitable screws (not provided) to secure the system to the rack and fully tighten.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> Ensure that ventilation holes are not obstructed. Leave enough space around the appliance for adequate ventilation or equipment damage can occur.</p>
