    <h1>Before Installing</h1>
    <p>Before installing the appliance, you must do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Review the <MadCap:xref href="#Safety-Guidelines">Safety Guidelines</MadCap:xref></li>
      <li>Verify that the site meets all of the listed <MadCap:xref href="#Env-Requirements">Environmental Requirements</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Review the <MadCap:xref href="#Cabling">Cabling Recommendations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Review the <MadCap:xref href="#preparing_your_site_1325169260_75402">Rack Requirements</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Verify that the electrical supply meets all power requirements. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm#3260-Tech-Specs">3260 Technical Specifications</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Ensure that all IP environment requirements are met, such as default gateway address, port IP address and mask, management Ethernet port IP address and mask, and broadcast address.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Safety-Guidelines"/>Safety Guidelines</h2>
    <p>For your safety, before installing the system, review and follow all safety warnings specified in this section.</p>
    <div class="Warning">
      <ul>
        <li>Solace PubSub+ 3260s are intended for installation and use in RESTRICTED ACCESS LOCATIONS ONLY. A restricted access location is one where access can only be gained by qualified service personnel through the use of a special tool, lock and key, or other means of security, and is controlled by the authority responsible for the location.</li>
        <li>Do not work on the appliance or connect or disconnect cables during electrical storms. If you proceed, you will be exposed to avoidable risk of severe injury or even death from electrocution.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Caution">
      <ul>
        <li>The recommended maximum ambient operating temperature for the appliance is 104° F (40° C). To prevent equipment damage, always consider the internal temperature of the rack for safe operation of the appliance.</li>
        <li>Install equipment in the rack from the bottom upward. This maintains the stability of the rack and reduces the chance of the rack tipping over.</li>
        <li>Connect the rack to ground (earth), and ensure that a reliable earthing path is maintained in the rack to prevent equipment damage from electrostatic discharge. When you install the appliance, the ground connection must always be made first and disconnected last.</li>
        <li>Always evaluate the overall loading of the power source circuit before you install any new appliance equipment into a rack. Failure to do so can result in serious equipment damage.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Env-Requirements"/>Environmental Requirements</h2>
    <p>Choose a location for the appliance that is dry, relatively dust-free, well-ventilated, and air-conditioned. Ensure that the floor is capable of supporting the combined weight of the rack and the installed equipment. Place the system in a location with sufficient access to power and network cables.</p>
    <p>Like other network devices, the appliance generates a significant amount of heat. It is important to provide a balanced environment for the appliance to perform properly and safely. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm">Connections, LEDs, and Specifications</MadCap:xref>for acceptable ranges of temperature and humidity.</p>
    <p>Allow enough space around the system for adequate ventilation. Inadequate ventilation can cause the system to overheat. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm">Connections, LEDs, and Specifications</MadCap:xref> for details about space requirements.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">Do not block the fan vents on the Solace PubSub+ 3260s. Otherwise, the appliance can overheat.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Cabling"/>Cabling Recommendations</h2>
    <p>Cabling should comply with the following recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Examine cables for cuts, bends, and nicks. Replace if necessary.</li>
      <li>Ensure that cable distance and rate limits meet IEEE-recommended maximum speeds and distances for signaling purposes.</li>
      <li>Ensure that power cables deliver sufficient power to the appliance.</li>
      <li>Route cables so that ventilation or airflow is not restricted.</li>
      <li>Route cables so that blades and field-replaceable units are easily accessible.</li>
      <li>Route cables in a logical direction to prevent loss of connectivity to other equipment in the rack, associated equipment in adjacent racks, or to the backbone network.</li>
      <li>Consider using cable-management brackets to keep network cables untangled and orderly and to prevent cables from hindering access to other slots.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="preparing_your_site_1325169260_75402"/>Rack Requirements</h2>
    <p>Use an open style, 19 in. (482.6 mm) wide rack to facilitate easy maintenance and provide proper ventilation. For a Solace PubSub+ 3260, a four-post rack or cabinet is required.</p>
    <p>Racks should conform to conventional standards. In the United States, use EIA Standard RS-310C: Racks, Panels, and Associated Equipment. In countries other than the United States, use IEC Standard 297. In addition, verify that your rack meets the basic mechanical and space requirements this section describes.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Use racks that meet the following mechanical recommendations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The rack should use the universal mounting rail hole pattern identified in <br/>IEC Standard 297.</li>
      <li>The mounting holes should be flush with the rails to accommodate the appliance chassis.</li>
      <li>The rack rails must be spaced widely enough to accommodate the appliance chassis’ external dimensions: 17 1/8 in. (43.5 mm) wide and 31 <span style="font-size: 80%;vertical-align: super;">3/4</span>in. (80.6 cm) deep.</li>
      <li>The rack should be made of steel or aluminum.</li>
      <li>When fully loaded, the rack should be structurally able to support 600 pounds (272 kilograms).</li>
      <li>In a closed cabinet, there must be a minimum of 6 in. (15.2 cm) of unobstructed airflow behind the appliance. Otherwise, airflow baffles must be installed to prevent recirculation of hot air and overheating.</li>
    </ul>
