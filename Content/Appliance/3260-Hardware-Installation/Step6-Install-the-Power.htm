    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 6: Install Power Supplies</h1>
    <p>To install the Solace PubSub+ 3260 power supplies, use the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Allow the power supplies to reach room temperature before installing.</li>
      <li>Ground yourself by using an antistatic wrist strap or other device.</li>
      <li>Do the following for each power supply, consecutively, one at a time:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Inspect the power supply to ensure that the pins and electrical connections are not damaged. </li><li>Turn the latch thumbscrew counterclockwise to ensure that the latching mechanism is free. When properly loosened, the thumbscrew remains in the latching mechanism but is able to move freely.

Do not use excessive force when inserting the power supply.
                <p class="SWSubstepResultLine">An audible click could be heard when the power supply is properly seated and the latch is fully engaged.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Inserting a Power Supply</p><p class="GraphicCaption"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/power_in_revised_scaled.png" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 450px; }" style="max-width: 450px;" alt=""/></p></li><li>Inspect the latch mechanism to ensure that it has engaged the power supply housing. When properly engaged, the latch is fully biased to the right—no portion of the latch slot will be visible to the left of the thumbscrew.
				
				<p class="SWSubstepResultLine">The figure below shows improperly and properly latched power supplies. The image on the left shows an improperly latched mechanism, which is biased to the left, exposing a large portion of the latch slot. The image on the right shows a properly latched mechanism.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Improperly and Properly Latched Power Supplies<img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/3260-Hardware-Installation/latch_improperly_installed.jpg" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 450px; }" style="max-width: 450px;" alt=""/></p></li><li>To ensure that the power supply is properly seated and latched, tug on the power supply handle with moderate force. You should not be able to unseat the power supply.</li></ol></li>
      <li>After all of the power supplies have been installed, insert the provided AC power cords in each power supply in sequence from slot 1 to slot 4 (that is, from top to bottom). 
                <p>Push firmly on the AC power cord to ensure it is fully inserted in the power supply socket.</p></li>
