    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 7: Connect Management Console</h1>
    <p>Before you power up the Solace PubSub+ 3260, you must set up a management console—a standard computer running third-party terminal emulation software— to allow you to configure a management IP address for the appliance using the appliance CLI.</p>
    <p>For initial access to the appliance, you must physically connect the management console directly to the system’s serial console port. This connection allows you to use the CLI to set an IP address on the system. Once you configure the IP address, you can access the appliance remotely.</p>
    <p>The default baud rate setting is 115,200 bps for the appliance’s RS-232 serial console port, with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>data bits set to 8</li>
      <li>parity set to none</li>
      <li>stop bits set to 1</li>
      <li>flow control set to none</li>
    </ul>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Faulty-Serial-Connection.flsnp"/>
    <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">If required, you can change the default baud rate setting for the RS-232 serial console port by using the <b>console baud-rate</b> Global CONFIG command in the appliance CLI after the appliance is powered up. Refer r to <MadCap:xref href="../Changing-Appliance-Baud-Rates.htm">Changing Appliance Serial Console Port Baud Rates</MadCap:xref> for details.</p>
    <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Notice  &lt;/b&gt;">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">The computer and terminal emulation software are not provided by Solace. Also, some terminal emulation software may require you to manually change the Return key setting so that it does not send double carriage returns to the system. A double carriage return setting may unintentionally skip required configuration steps (by using defaults) when running the <b>setup</b> Privileged EXEC command.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To connect to a management console, follow this procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect the provided straight-through RS-232 cable (with DB-9/RJ-45 connectors) to the RS-232 serial console port located on the rear panel of the Solace PubSub+ 3260.        <p>Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm#Rear">3260 Rear Panel View</MadCap:xref> for location.</p></li>
      <li>Connect the other end of the cable to the DB-9 serial port on the management console.				
                <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">For some laptop computers, a customer-supplied DB-9 to Universal Serial Bus (USB) serial converter is required for the management console port.</p></li>
    </ol>
