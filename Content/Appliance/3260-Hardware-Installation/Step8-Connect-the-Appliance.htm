    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 8: Provide Power to the Appliance</h1>
    <p>This procedure is intended for the qualified power supply installer, who should have experience with electronic circuitry and wiring practices. Use the following information in conjunction with the safety information contained herein and the safety guidelines listed in <MadCap:xref href="Before-Installing-3260.htm">Before Installing</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>When initially installing the Solace PubSub+ 3260 or changing the power cabling, verify the power sources by checking that both power supply LEDs are green after the system powers up.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <ul>
        <li>To prevent equipment damage from electrostatic discharge, always ensure that the system chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an antistatic wrist strap, or another antistatic device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</li>
        <li>If one of the redundant power supplies in your system is found to be defective, Solace recommends that you leave the defective power supply in the system until the replacement unit arrives to ensure that correct airflow is maintained in the system. Refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:hardware_maintenance_tasks_for_3260s_2803166936_38232" href="../Hardware-Maintenance-Tasks/Replacing-Power-Supplies.htm">Replacing Power Supplies</MadCap:xref> for the hot swap replacement procedure.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Warning">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> To avoid the risk of personal injury or death from electric shock, before performing any of the following power supply procedures, unplug the power cord from the power source outlet on AC units.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The Solace PubSub+ 3260 with an AC-input power supply has a three-pronged International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) connector for an AC power cord.</p>
    <p>To turn on power for the Solace PubSub+ 3260, follow this procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Verify that an appropriate AC power source is operational and turned on.
                <div class="Warning"><p class="Tbl_Body">AC-powered systems rely on the buildingâ€™s installation or power supply for overcurrent protection. Ensure that a listed and certified fuse or circuit breaker is used to protect the system from short circuits.</p></div></li>
      <li>For each installed power supply, insert the female end of the supplied AC power cord first to the power connector located on the AC-input power supply module, then insert the male end of each cord into a three-terminal, single-phase power source that provides AC power within the acceptable range.
        <p class="Note">Two installed and working power supplies are required for the Solace PubSub+ 3260 to turn up successfully. The third and fourth installed power supplies provide redundancy, load sharing, and increased system availability. They can be removed without affecting system operation.</p></li>
      <li>Use a paper clip to press the 1/0 button on the front panel of the appliance, located on the right-hand side below the LEDs, to turn power on to the appliance.</li>
      <li>Monitor the LEDs on the front of the appliance to verify that it is powering up properly.                <p>Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm#Front">3260 Front Panel View</MadCap:xref> for LED status explanation.</p></li>
      <li>Verify that the Green LED located in the upper right-hand corner of each power supply is on.        <p class="SWStep">The CLI <b>login</b> prompt displays on your management console screen:</p><pre xml:space="preserve">SolOS release 7.x.x.x
login: </pre><h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Troubleshooting"/>Troubleshooting</h2><p>If you encounter problems when you power on the system, check the following items:</p><ul><li>With the power on, is the blue PWR LED on the front panel on?<ul><li>If not, check the AC input, AC source, system circuit breaker, and the power supply cable (AC).</li><li>If the blue PWR LED is still off, the problem might be a power supply failure. Verify that the Green LED located in the upper right-hand corner of each power supply is on.</li></ul></li><li>Does the system shut down after being on a short time?<ul><li>Check the fans. If the fans are not working, the system overheats and shuts itself down.</li><li>Ensure that the chassis intake and exhaust vents are clear.</li></ul></li></ul><p>If you have questions or need help, <a href="../../get-support.htm" class="link-internal">contact Solace</a>.</p></li>
