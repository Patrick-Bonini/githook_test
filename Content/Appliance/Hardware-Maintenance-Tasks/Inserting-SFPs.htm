    <div class="Caution">
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid getting dust and other contaminants into the optical bores of your SFP or SFP+ modules as the optics do not work correctly when obstructed with dust. Protect your SFP or SFP+ modules by inserting clean dust plugs into them after the fiber cables are removed, and be sure to clean the optic surfaces of the fiber cables before you plug them back into the optical bores of an SFP or SFP+ module.</li>
        <li>Always follow ESD prevention procedures when inserting or removing SFP or SFP+ modules. Use an anti-static device. If no anti-static device is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the appliance chassis.</li>
        <li>Always wear a grounded wrist strip when working on appliance equipment.</li>
        <li>Treat all assemblies, components, and interface connections as static-sensitive.</li>
        <li>Avoid working in carpeted areas and keep body movement to a minimum while removing or installing SFP modules to minimize the buildup of static charge.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Warning">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> Invisible laser radiation may be emitted form disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Insertin"/>Inserting SFP Modules</h2>
    <p>To insert a bale-clasp SFP or SFP+ module into a module port, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Close the bale-clasp before inserting the SFP or SFP+ module.</li>
      <li>Line up the module with the port, with the printed label facing down.
			<div class="Caution"><p class="Tbl_Body">Do not remove the rubber protectors on the end of optical SFP or SFP+ modules until they are installed and ready for cable connection and use. This is to avoid getting dust and other contaminants into the optical bores of the modules as the optics do not work correctly when obstructed with dust.</p></div></li>
      <li>Gently slide the module into the port.</li>
      <li>Gently press the module into the port until it is firmly seated.</li>
      <li>Connect the cable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Removing"/>Removing SFP Modules</h2>
    <p>To remove a bale-clasp SFP or SFP+ module from a module port in a blade, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the cable connected to the SFP or SFP+ module, if any.</li>
      <li>Open the bale clasp on the module with your index finger in a downward direction.              <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: Â &lt;/b&gt;">If the bale clasp is obstructed and you cannot use your index finger to open it, use a small, flat-blade screwdriver or other long, narrow instrument to open the bale clasp.</p></li>
      <li>Grasp the module between your thumb and index finger, and carefully pull it towards you out from the port.</li>
    </ol>
