    <p>This section provides information for how to replace power supplies in Solace PubSub+ appliances.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">If your appliance is running with redundant power supplies installed and one is found to be defective, Solace recommends that you leave the defective power supply in the appliance until the replacement unit arrives to ensure that correct airflow is maintained in the appliance.</p>

    <p>Before hot swapping appliance power supplies, review all safety warnings in this section.</p>
    <p>Use this information in conjunction with the safety information contained herein and the safety guidelines listed in <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:preparing_your_site_650552727_11460" href="../3230-Hardware-Installation/Preparing-Your-Site.htm">Preparing Your Site</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <div class="Warning">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> To avoid the risk of personal injury or death from electric shock, before performing any of the following power supply procedures, unplug the power cord from the power source outlet on AC units to ensure that power is removed.</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> Wear protective gloves when hot swapping the power supply to keep from being burned. Under full load conditions the power supply can be very hot.</p>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">To prevent equipment damage from Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), always ensure that the appliance chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an anti-static wrist strap, or another anti-static device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</p>

    <p>PubSub+ 3230s and PubSub+ 3260s house multiple hot‑swappable AC power supplies in bays at the rear of the unit. Hot swapping allows you to remove and install a power supply without powering down the appliance.</p>
    <p>A PubSub+ 3230 is provided with two power supplies. A single installed power supply meets the PubSub+ 3230 requirements, while the other installed power supply provides redundancy, load sharing, and increased event broker availability. The second power supply can be removed without directly affecting event broker operation.</p>
    <p>A PubSub+ 3260 with a CHS-3260AC-02, CHS-3260AC-03, or CHS-3260AC-04 chassis is provided with four power supplies. Two installed power supplies meet the PubSub+ 3260 requirements; the other installed power supplies provide redundancy, load sharing, and increased event broker availability. They can be removed without directly affecting event broker operation.</p>

    <p>To remove a power supply, use the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use an anti-static wrist strap or other device to ground yourself.</li>
      <li>Put on protective gloves to keep from being burned by a hot power supply.</li>
      <li>Facing the rear of the appliance, identify the failed power supply by checking the bay that it is installed in, and checking that the Green LED on the power supply is off.        <p class="GraphicCaption">Power Supply Rear View</p><p style="text-align: left;"><img src="Images/2_27.jpg" style="width: 291.0874px;height: 197.135px;max-width: 250px;" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 250px; }" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>Unplug the power cable from the power connector to ensure that power is removed.</li>
      <li>Loosen by hand the captive screw located above the AC-input power connector.</li>

    <h3><a name="Installi"/>Step 2: Installing Power Supplies</h3>
    <p>To install a power supply, use the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Allow the power supplies to reach room temperature before installing.</li>
      <li>Use an anti-static wrist strap or other device to ground yourself.</li>
      <li>Do the following for each power supply to be installed, consecutively, one at a time:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Inspect the power supply to ensure that the pins and electrical connections are not damaged. </li><li>Turn the latch thumbscrew counterclockwise to ensure that the latching mechanism is free. When properly loosened, the thumbscrew remains in the latching mechanism but is able to move freely.

    </ol>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Troubles2"/>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>If you encounter problems with the hot-swapped power supply installation, check the following items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With the power on, for a PubSub+ 3230/3260 is the blue PWR LED on the front panel on ? For a PubSub+ 3530/3560, is the front LED a steady blue color?</li>
      <li>If it is unlit, check the AC input, AC source, appliance circuit breaker, and the power supply cable.</li>
      <li>If the blue power LED is still unlit, the problem might be a power supply failure.</li>
      <li>If it is flashing, the appliance hardware has successfully initialized but the software has not.</li>
      <li>Does the appliance shut down after being on a short time?</li>
      <li>If the system temperatures rise rapidly, the appliance can overheat and shut itself down due to insufficient air flow. Monitor the system temperatures and chassis fan status by entering the <code>show environment</code> User EXEC command.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the chassis fans are working.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the chassis intake and exhaust vents are clear.</li>
    </ul>
