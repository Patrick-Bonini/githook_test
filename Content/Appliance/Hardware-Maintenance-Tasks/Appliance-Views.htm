    <p>The front panel  of a PubSub+ 3230 (CHS-3230AC-01 and CHS-3230AC-02 chassis) features three LEDs that indicate power status, hard drive status, and ethernet status. Additionally, the front panel features two recessed buttons: the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/standby_button.png" alt="on/standby button" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;"/> on/standby button and the RST button.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The rear panel  of PubSub+ 3230 features six full size PCIe slots. The rear panel also features two AC power supply bays. A single installed power supply is sufficient in providing power to the appliance; however, the additional power supply is able to provide redundancy, load sharing, and increased event broker availability.</p>

    <p>The figure below shows a rear view of CHS-3260AC-02 chassis. The rear panel features six full size PCIe slots distributed across twin fabric expansion cartridges (FECs). The rear panel also features four AC power supply bays. Two installed power supplies are sufficient in providing power to the appliance; however, the two additional power supplies are able to provide redundancy, load sharing, and increased appliance availability.</p>
