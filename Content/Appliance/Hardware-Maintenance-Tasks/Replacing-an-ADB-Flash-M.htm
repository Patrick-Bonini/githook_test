    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>ADB Flash Memory Card Replacement</h1>
    <p>This section describes how to replace a failed Solace ADB flash memory card in an ADB-000000-01 with a new Solace-provided flash memory card.</p>
    <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">A flash memory card can only be replaced on ADB- 000000-01. Further, only install a Solace-provided flash memory card into ADB-000000-01—other memory cards are not supported. On ADB-000000-02 and ADB-04210M-01-A, the flash memory card is internal to the blade and is not accessible nor removable.</p>
    <p>The figure below shows the faceplate of an ADB-000000-01. The ADB faceplate is accessible at the rear of the appliance chassis.</p>

    </p>
    <p>In the ADB faceplate there is a slot where the flash memory card used by the ADB is installed. The ADB faceplate also features a red LED that indicates the read/write status for the Solace-provided flash memory card as reported by the ADB. The following states are possible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Off</u>: No reading or writing of spooled messages from the flash memory card.</li>
      <li><u>On</u>: Initialization, read, or write operations are occurring for the flash memory card.</li>
      <li><u>Blinking</u>: The Solace provided flash memory card is not present, or is incorrectly installed. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before replacing ADB flash memory cards, review the following safety warning.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p> To prevent equipment damage from Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), always ensure that the appliance chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an anti-static wrist strap, or another anti-static device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Use an anti-static wrist strap or other device to ground yourself.</li>
      <li>When the flash memory card LED is in an OFF state, press the flash memory card that is currently installed in the ADB to eject it from the flash memory card slot.

    <p>To install a Solace-provided replacement flash memory card, use the following procedure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use an anti-static wrist strap or other device to ground yourself.</li>
      <li>When the flash memory card LED is in a Blinking state (no flash memory card is present), slide the Solace-provided flash memory card with the printed label facing right into the slot on the ADB faceplate, and gently press until it is firmly seated.</li>
      <li>The red flash memory card LED should turn On, to indicate that data being read or written to the flash memory card, or be Blank, to indicate that the flash memory card is successfully installed, but data is not being read or written to the card.</li>
      <li>If the LED is in a Blinking state, the flash memory card is not readable (for example, it might not be properly seated).</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p> Only install a replacement flash memory card that Solace has provided for the specific ADB and Solace PubSub+ version used by your appliance. <br/>Do not attempt to install a flash memory card not supplied by Solace or a Solace provided flash memory card in the ADB of another appliance that uses an earlier version of Solace PubSub+. Installing an incompatible flash memory card can result in undefined and inconsistent event broker behavior.</p>
