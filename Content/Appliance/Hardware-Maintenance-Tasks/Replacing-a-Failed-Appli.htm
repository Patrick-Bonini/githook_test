    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Replacing a Failed Appliance in a Redundant Pair</h1>
    <p>This section describes in general terms how to replace a failed Solace PubSub+ appliance in a deployed high-availability (HA) redundant pair. The steps that must be performed are dependent on whether the appliance to be replaced was configured as active or backup and whether the Configâ€‘Sync facility can be used to copy the configuration to the replacement appliance.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="ESD/Safe"/>ESD/Safety Precautions</h2>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p> To prevent equipment damage from Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), always ensure that the appliance chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an anti-static wrist strap, or another anti-static device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Tool"/>Tool and Equipment Requirements</h2>
    <p>The following tools and equipment are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>electrostatic discharge wrist strap</li>
      <li>anti-static mat</li>
      <li>replacement appliance</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Procedur"/>Procedure</h2>
    <p>Perform the following general steps provide in this example to replace a failed appliance in a deployed HA redundant pair. In this example, the <code>solace1</code> is the active appliance and <code>solace2</code> is the appliance that has failed and must be replaced.</p>
    <p class="Note">If you require further assistance, or if you have any questions regarding this procedure, <a href="../../get-support.htm" class="link-internal">contact Solace</a> for technical support.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p> When replacing a failed appliance in a deployed HA redundant pair, do NOT physically connect the HBA links between the replacement appliance and the external disk storage unit, do NOT physically connect the NAB in the replacement appliance to the network, and do NOT physically connect the ADB links between the replacement appliance and paired in-service appliance until explicitly instructed to do so in the steps in the following procedure.</p>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li>On the currently active appliance, enter the following Solace CLI commands to ensure that auto revert is not enabled.
        <pre>solace1&gt; enable
solace1# configure
solace1(configure)# redundancy
solace1(configure/redundancy)# no auto-revert
solace1(configure/redundancy)# end
solace1#</pre></li>
      <li>Install the replacement appliance in the hardware rack, power it up, and connect a management console.        <p>For more information, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Appliance-Set-Up/Hardware-Installation.htm"> Solace Appliance Hardware Installation</MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="Turning-Appliance-Power.htm">Turning Appliance Power On or Off Without the CLI</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="../Appliance-Set-Up/Connecting-M-Consoles.htm">Connecting Management Consoles</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
      <li>Using the management console, run set-up and configure only the management IP address and default route for the replacement appliance.

      <li>Enter the following show command to display the HBA Port and Node names for the replacement appliance:

      <li>Using the displayed HBA Port and Node names from the output, register the HBA ports with the proper storage Logical Unit Number (LUN) on the external disk storage array.</li>
      <li class="SWStep">Enter the following show command to ensure that the correct version of Solace PubSub+ software is installed on the replacement appliance.
        <pre>solace2&gt; show version</pre></li>
      <p>If necessary, upgrade or downgrade the version to match that of the version used by the mate appliance.

      <li>To apply the configuration of the active event broker to the replacement appliance, you can either apply a saved backup configuration file to the replacement mate appliance or use the Config-Sync facility to apply the configuration of the active event broker to the replacement mate appliance:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>To apply a backup configuration file to the replacement appliance, refer to step 8.</li>
        <li>To use the Config-Sync facility assert the active event broker's configuration on to the replacement appliance, refer to step 9.</li>

        <p>If necessary, restore the autoâ€‘revert redundancy setting.</p>
        <p class="Note">Solace recommends that the auto revert redundancy configuration should normally be kept disabled on an event broker. However, if you do want to use auto revert for your event broker, it should be re-enabled at this point.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the following commands to verify that the replacement event broker is in the correct redundancy state.
