    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Redundant Power Supply Settings</h1>
    <p>Solace PubSub+ appliances use redundant AC hot-swappable power supplies.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>PubSub+ 3530s and 3560s use two redundant AC hot-swappable power supplies—one installed power supply meets the system requirements, and the second installed power supply provides redundancy, load sharing, and increased system availability.</li>
      <li>PubSub+ 3260s use three or four redundant AC hot-swappable power supplies—two installed power supplies meet the system requirements. The third and fourth installed power supplies provide redundancy, load sharing, and increased system availability, and they can be removed (or inserted) without affecting system operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a Solace PubSub+ 3260 you can configure the redundant power supply parameter that raises syslog event message when the number of active power supplies detected on the appliance is less than the configured power redundancy parameter.</p>
    <p>To configure the redundant power supply setting on a Solace PubSub+ 3260, enter the following CONFIG command:</p>
    <p class="Code">solace(configure)# hardware power-redundancy &lt;type&gt;</p>
    <p><u>Where</u>:</p>
    <p><code>type</code> specifies the redundant power supply configuration to use for the appliance. Valid values for a PubSub+ 3260 are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2+1 (requires at least three active power supplies) </li>
      <li>2+2 (requires four active power supplies). This is the default for a Solace PubSub+ 3260. </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="Note">
      <ul>
        <li>1+1 is the only possible redundant power supply setting for Solace PubSub+ 3530s and 3560s. </li>
      </ul>
