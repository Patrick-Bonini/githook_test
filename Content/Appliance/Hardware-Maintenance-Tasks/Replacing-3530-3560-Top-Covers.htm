    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Removal"/>Removal</h2>
    <p>To remove a 3530/3560 appliance's top cover, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
			If the chassis’s mounting-bracket flanges are fastened to the rack, remove or disengage the fasteners to allow the chassis to slide out on its slide rails.</li>
      <li>Grasp the pull handles located at the front of the chassis and pull the appliance out of the rack on its slide rails so that the top cover is accessible.</li>
      <li>Use a Philips No. 2 screwdriver to undo the captive fastener for each of the two latch pin covers, and then lift the covers to expose the latching pins.                <p class="GraphicCaption">Covers Up, Pins Exposed</p><p class="GraphicCaption"><img src="Images/covers_up.jpg" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>Pull out and hold the cover’s two latching pins.</li>
      <li>While holding the release pins out, slide the cover toward the rear of the appliance chassis.

    </ol>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Attachme"/>Attachment</h2>
    <p>To reattach a 3530/3560 appliance's top cover, do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the cover on top of the appliance chassis, positioned just behind the front faceplate.
			<p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">There are arrows at near the sides of the top cover and at the sides of the chassis. When you line up these arrows the top cover will drop down onto the chassis.</p></li>
      <li>Slide the cover towards the front of the appliance chassis until it is fully secured.
			<p>The cover’s two latching pins automatically lock into place when the cover is properly reattached.</p><p class="GraphicCaption">Sliding the Cover into Place</p><p class="GraphicCaption"><img src="Images/cover_slide_in_place.jpg" alt=""/></p></li>
      <li>Flip the latch pin covers down into place and use a Philips No. 2 screwdriver to securely tighten the captive fasteners.</li>
      <li>Slide the appliance chassis back into the rack.</li>
      <li>
        <p>If the chassis’ mounting-bracket flanges were fastened to the rack when you began, engage the fasteners to secure the chassis in the rack.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
