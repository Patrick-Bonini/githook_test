    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Product Handling Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Follow these general shipping and handling rules to avoid potentially hazardous situations or damage to the equipment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not unpack a Solace PubSub+ 3530 until you are ready to install it. Keep the chassis in the shipping container to prevent accidental damage until you have determined where you want to install the appliance.</li>
      <li>Install appliances and sub-assemblies immediately after removal from the protective packaging.</li>
      <li>Verify that all site preparations are complete prior to installation.</li>
      <li>Allow the equipment to sit for a minimum of one hour before proceeding with installation.</li>
      <li>Never attempt to lift an object that might be too heavy for one person. For example, the Solace PubSub+ 3530’s equipment shelf weighs approximately 40 lbs (18 kg).</li>
      <li>Maintain a solid footing and ensure that equipment is situated between feet before lifting.</li>
      <li>Remove packing material from the area prior to handling.</li>
      <li>Secure any loose cabling to the equipment prior to handling.</li>
      <li>Never install equipment that appears damaged.</li>
      <li>Ensure that Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) precautions are taken when handling appliances and sub‑assemblies.</li>
    </ul>

            </a>Product Safety Labels</h2>
    <p>Product safety labels warn service personnel of any potential hazards. To prevent personal injury, equipment damage, or service interruptions, follow all precautionary messages found on product safety labels and in the product documentation, as well as the safety procedures established by your company.</p>

            </a>ESD Prevention Rules</h2>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">To prevent equipment damage from electrostatic discharge, always ensure that the appliance chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an antistatic wrist strap, or another antistatic device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Take the following precautions to minimize the risk of damage from ESD:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always observe proper ESD handling techniques and use of personal grounding devices when working on shelves and cables connected to blades.</li>
      <li>Test the integrity of the ESD-preventative wrist or ankle strap daily. The resistance value should be between 1 and 10 megaohms.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the ESD-preventive strap makes contact with skin.</li>
      <li>Do not permit system components to contact clothing. ESD protection is only effective for the body.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Install system blades (as applicable) immediately after removal from the antistatic packaging. All Solace equipment is provided in antistatic packaging.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
