    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 3: Connect a Management Console</h1>
    <p>Before you power up the Solace PubSub+ 3530, you must set up a management console (a standard computer running third-party terminal emulation software), and physically connect the management console directly to the appliance’s serial console port. This connection allows you to use the Solace CLI to set a management IP address for the event broker. Once you configure the IP address, you can remotely access the event broker.</p>
    <p>The default baud rate setting is 115,200 bps for the appliance’s RS-232 serial console port, with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>data bits set to 8</li>
      <li>parity set to none</li>
      <li>stop bits set to 1</li>
      <li>flow control set to RTS/CTS (sometimes referred to as "hard" or "hardware")</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your terminal emulation software does not support hardware flow control, set the flow control value to none.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Faulty-Serial-Connection.flsnp"/>
    <p class="Note">If required, you can change the default baud rate setting for the RS-232 serial console port by using the <b>console baud-rate</b> Global CONFIG command in the Solace CLI after the appliance is powered up. Referr to <MadCap:xref href="../Changing-Appliance-Baud-Rates.htm">Changing Appliance Serial Console Port Baud Rates</MadCap:xref> for details.</p>
    <div class="Note">
      <p class="Tbl_Body">The computer and terminal emulation software are not provided by Solace. Also, some terminal emulation software may require you to manually change the Return key setting so that it does not send double carriage returns to the event broker. A double carriage return setting may unintentionally skip required configuration steps (by using defaults) when running the <b>setup</b> Privileged EXEC command.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To connect a management console to the appliance:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect the provided RS-232 cable (with DB-9/RJ-45 connectors) to the RS-232 serial console port located on the rear panel of the appliance.
        <p>Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm#Rear-Panel">Rear Panel View of 3530</MadCap:xref> for location.</p></li>
      <li>Connect the other end of the cable to the DB-9 serial port on the management console. 
        <p class="Note">For some laptop computers, a customer-supplied DB-9 to Universal Serial Bus (USB) serial converter is required for the management console port.</p></li>
    </ol>
