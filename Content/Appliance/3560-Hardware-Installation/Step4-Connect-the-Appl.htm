    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Step 4: Provide Power to the Appliance</h1>
    <p>The Solace PubSub+ 3560 has two redundant AC hot‑swappable power supplies (PS1 and PS2) in bays at the rear of the appliance.</p>
    <p>A single installed power supply meets the appliance requirements. The second installed power supply provides redundancy, load sharing, and increased appliance availability, and can be removed (or inserted) without affecting appliance operation.</p>
    <p>This procedure is intended for a qualified power supply installer who is experienced with electronic circuitry and wiring practices. Use the following information in conjunction with the safety information contained herein, and the safety guidelines listed in <MadCap:xref href="Preparing-Your-Site.htm">
          Preparing Your Site</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <div class="Caution" MadCap:conditions="Default.NotForPDF">
      <ul>
        <li>To prevent equipment damage from electrostatic discharge, always ensure that the appliance chassis is electrically connected to earth ground. Always follow ESD prevention procedures when removing and replacing power supplies. Use an anti-static wrist strap, or another anti-static device. If no wrist strap or mat is available, ground yourself by touching the metal part of the chassis.</li>
        <li>If one of the redundant power supplies in your appliance is found to be defective, Solace recommends that you leave the defective power supply in the appliance until the replacement unit arrives to ensure that the appliance maintains the correct airflow. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Hardware-Maintenance-Tasks/Replacing-Power-Supplies.htm">Replacing Power Supplies</MadCap:xref> for the replacement procedure.</li>

    <p>To turn on power for the Solace PubSub+ 3560:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Verify that an appropriate AC power source is operational and turned on.
        <div class="Warning" MadCap:conditions="Default.NotForPDF"><p class="Tbl_Body"> AC-powered appliances rely on the building’s installation or power supply for overcurrent protection. Ensure that a listed and certified fuse or circuit breaker is used to protect the appliance from short circuits.</p></div><div class="Caution" MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlyForPDF"><img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/banner_warning_shortest.gif" style="max-height: 28px;" alt=""/><p class="Tbl_Body"><b>WARNING!</b> AC-powered appliances rely on the building’s installation or power supply for overcurrent protection. Ensure that a listed and certified fuse or circuit breaker is used to protect the appliance from short circuits.</p></div></li>
      <li>Connect the two provided AC power cables to the power connectors located on each AC input power supply.
        <p>The Solace PubSub+ 3560 with an AC-input power supply uses a three‑pronged International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) connector for an AC power cord.</p></li>
      <li>Connect the two AC power cords into a three-terminal, single-phase power source that provides AC power within the acceptable range.</li>
      <li>To turn power on to the appliance, press the (<img src="../../Resources/Images/Appliance/standby_button.png" style="width: 14.39904px;height: 16.79904px;vertical-align: text-bottom;" alt="Standy button"/>) on/standby button located on the lower left-hand side of the rear panel of the appliance.</li>
      <li>Monitor the LEDs on the front of the appliance to verify that it is powering up properly.
        <p>Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Connections-LEDs-Specs.htm">Connections, LEDs, and Specifications</MadCap:xref> for LED status explanation.</p></li>
      <li>Verify that the Green LED located in the upper right-hand corner of each power supply is on.            <p>The CLI <b>login</b> prompt displays on your management console screen:</p><p class="Code">SolOS release &lt;version&gt;</p><p class="Code">login:</p><p>The appliance can now be quickly configured through the <b>setup</b> Privileged EXEC command in the Solace CLI (refer to<MadCap:xref href="../Appliance-Set-Up/Initializing-Appliances.htm"> Initializing Appliances</MadCap:xref>). <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlyForPDF">For this procedure, go to docs.solace.com.</MadCap:conditionalText></p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Troubles"/>Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>If you encounter problems when you power on the appliance, check the following items:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With the power on, is the blue PWR LED on the front panel on?<ul><li>If not, check the AC input, AC source, appliance circuit breaker, and the AC power supply cable.</li><li>If the blue PWR LED is still off, the problem might be a power supply failure. Verify that the Green LED located in the upper right-hand corner of each power supply is on.</li></ul></li>
      <li>Does the appliance shut down after being on for a short time?<ul><li>Check the fans. If the fans are not working, the appliance overheats and shuts itself down.</li><li>Ensure that the chassis intake and exhaust vents are clear.</li></ul></li>
    </ul>
