    <h1><a name="Getting_Started_Appliances"/>Setting up the PubSub+ Appliance</h1>
    <p>The purpose of this section is to show you how to get a Solace PubSub+ appliance operational and ready for messaging after it has been  installed and powered up using the      instructions  in <MadCap:xref href="Hardware-Installation.htm">Solace Appliance Hardware Installation</MadCap:xref>. The following tasks guide you through the set up of the minimum configuration necessary to get clients connected and exchanging messages,</p>

        <MadCap:xref href="Setting-Basic-Configurations.htm">Setting Up Basic Configurations</MadCap:xref>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When finished, you can then remotely log on to the appliance through a Secure Shell (SSH) connection to the management interface, as well as ping the message backbone interface.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that the information provided in this section only covers the deployment of a single appliance and does not take high-availability (HA) redundancy into consideration.</p>
