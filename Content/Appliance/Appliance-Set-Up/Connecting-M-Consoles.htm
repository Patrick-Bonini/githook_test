    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Connecting a Management Console</h1>
    <p>To configure an appliance, you must set up a management console—a standard computer running any third-party terminal emulation software—to allow you to configure the event broker without an IP address using the Solace CLI.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Faulty-Serial-Connection.flsnp"/>
    <p>To connect a management console, perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect the provided straight-through RS-232 cable (with DB-9/RJ-45 connectors) to the RS-232 serial console port located on the rear panel of the event broker.
        <p>The default baud rate setting for the RS-232 serial console port is:</p><ul><li>115,200 bps for Solace PubSub+ 3260, 3530, and 3560 appliances</li><li>9,600 bps for Solace PubSub+ 3230 appliances</li><li>data bits set to 8</li><li>parity set to none</li><li>stop bits set to 1</li><li>flow control set to none</li></ul><p>If required, you can change the default baud rate setting for the RS-232 serial console port through the Solace CLI after the router is powered up (refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Changing-Appliance-Baud-Rates.htm">Changing Appliance Serial Console Port Baud Rates</MadCap:xref>).</p></li>
      <li>Connect the other end of the cable to the DB-9 serial port on the management console.</li>
    </ol>
