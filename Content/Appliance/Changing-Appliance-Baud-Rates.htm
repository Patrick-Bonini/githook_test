    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Appliance"/>Configuring the Baud Rate of the Serial Console Port</h1>
    <p class="SWStepFirst">To change the baud rate setting for a PubSub+ appliance’s RS-232 serial console port, enter the following commands:</p>
    <p class="Code">solace# configure<br/>solace(configure)# console baud-rate &lt;baud-rate&gt;</p>
    <p><u>Where</u>:</p>
    <p><code>baud-rate</code> is the desired baud rate setting for the RS-232 serial console port in bits per second (bps). Valid values are 110, 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200. The default value is 115200 on Solace PubSub+ 3260, 3530, and 3560.</p>
    <p>To view the baud rate used for the RS-232 serial console port, enter the <code>show console</code> command. Note that this command does not apply to PubSub+ software event brokers.</p>
    <p>The console has the following RS-232 configuration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>8 data bits</li>
      <li>0 parity bits (turn Parity checking off)</li>
      <li>1 stop bit (RS232 allows 1, 1.5 and 2)</li>
      <li>No flow control</li>
      <li>Baud rate configurable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The baud rate setting of the RS-232 connection is affected by the length of the cable used between the appliance and the datacenter terminal server. The higher the baud rate, the shorter the cable length. The default 115,200 baud rate setting is designed for a shorter cable length to the ‘top of rack’ terminal server found in newer data centres. For data centres where larger terminal servers are deployed that serve a suite of racks, the default setting should be changed to allow longer cables and reliable communication. The value of 9,600 is a standard terminal server speed for such terminal server/console deployment style.</p>
    <p class="Note">Note that both ends of the RS232 connection must have the same configuration.</p>
