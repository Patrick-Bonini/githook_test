    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Software;Appliance"/>Network Monitoring</h1>
    <p>The event broker provides various mechanisms to monitor its status and troubleshoot network problems by displaying, for example, summary screens of network statistics. There are a number of CLI commands that can be run to collect this data and investigate network level issues. They classify as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display IP Networking status</li>
      <li>Display event broker status</li>
      <li>Monitor event broker status</li>
      <li>Display subscription database contents</li>
      <li>Display network statistics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each CLI command also has an equivalent SEMP counterpart; hence, a monitoring application can obtain this information using request/reply SEMP as described in <MadCap:xref href="Monitoring-Events.htm#Request">Request / Reply Monitoring using SEMP</MadCap:xref>.</p>
