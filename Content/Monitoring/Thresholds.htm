    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Software;Appliance"/>Thresholds</h1>
    <p>Thresholds that cause certain events to be triggered can be configured on an event broker. There are two types of thresholds: set and clear. The set threshold triggers the event broker to raise a set event when the configured threshold is exceeded. The clear threshold triggers the event broker to raise a clear event if the set event was triggered, but the level has now fallen below the configured clear threshold.  The region between the upper threshold and the clear threshold is referred to as the hysteresis zone.  You should tune the thresholds to ensure the proper hysteresis zone to prevent alarms and events from being constantly triggered due to small fluctuations.</p>
    <p>Solace recommends that you initially use the default threshold settings with your event broker to see how they apply to your network. After assessing your network's normal behavior, the threshold and alarm settings can be adjusted to make them more applicable to your network.</p>
