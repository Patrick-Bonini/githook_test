    <p>These stages are specific to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. For details about our software and hardware broker products, see the <a class="link-offsite" href="https://solace.com/support/product-lifecycle-policy/" target="_blank"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> Product Lifecycle Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>Access to features in certain release stages will either be provided automatically after system upgrades, or special requests may be made to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>. </p>
    <p class="Note">Features may not go through every release stage.</p>
    <h2><a name="Early_Access"/>Early Access</h2>
    <p>Early Access (EA) feature releases are limited to a closed group of testers for a limited subset of feature launches. Participation is optional or by invitation and may require signing an agreement before the feature release is made available, including confidentiality provisions.  These features may be unstable, change in backward-incompatible ways, and are not guaranteed to be released. There are no <a href="https://solace.com/products/event-broker/cloud/service-level-agreements/" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Service Level Agreements</a> (SLA) provided and no technical support obligations.  Early Access feature releases are rare and focus on validating new product capabilities.</p>
    <h2><a name="Beta"/>Beta</h2>
    <p>At Beta, products or features are ready for broader customer testing and use and are supported by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>. Betas are often publicly announced. There are no SLAs in a Beta release unless otherwise specified in the product terms or the terms of a particular Beta program. Products are complete from a feature perspective, but may have some outstanding open issues or may require some product or feature behavior changes as it moves toward General Availability (GA).</p>
    <h2><a name="Controlled_Availability"/>Controlled Availability</h2>
    <p>Controlled Availability (CA) products and features are fully functional and available to customers upon request. These features are targeted for  specific use cases, may require <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to enable,  and often require additional support from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to configure. Our SLAs cover CA features, but the coverage may be subject to limitations or specific use cases.</p>
    <h2><a name="General_Availability"/>General Availability</h2>
    <p>General Availability (GA) products and features are open to all customers, covered by our SLAs, and are ready for production use.</p>
    <h2><a name="Deprecated"/>Deprecated</h2>
    <p>Deprecated features are scheduled to be disabled and removed from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. Deprecation, shutdown, or removal timelines
            are communicated, and customers are encouraged to <a href="../get-support.htm" target="_blank" class="link-internal">contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></a> if deprecation will have an impact on their business.</p>
