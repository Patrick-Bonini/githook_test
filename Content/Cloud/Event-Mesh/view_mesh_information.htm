    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Viewing Information and Details of an Event Mesh</h1>
    <p>You can view the details of an event mesh that's been created after you've created it in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager"/>. To view the details of an event mesh, you require the correct role assigned to your user profile. For more information about roles required, see <MadCap:xref href="about_event_meshes.htm#considerations-working-with-event-meshes">Considerations for Working with Event Meshes in [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_short%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>To view information or details about an event mesh, you can perform the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check the progress of an event mesh when you create, update, or delete it. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#check-event-mesh-progress"> Check Progress of an Event Mesh</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Discover the event meshes are in your account. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#scan-for-new-mesh">Scanning and Refreshing for New Event Meshes</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Refresh the view of an event mesh. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#reresh-view">Refreshing for Changes in an Existing Event Mesh</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>View the details of an event mesh and the status of a Health Check. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#view-event-mesh-details">Viewing the Event Mesh and Service Details</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Interact with the map to get additional information. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#advanced-ui-interactions">Advanced Interaction with Event Mesh from the Map View</MadCap:xref>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before view an event mesh, we recommend that you review the considerations. For this information, see <MadCap:xref href="about_event_meshes.htm#considerations-working-with-event-meshes">Considerations for Working with Event Meshes</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h2><a name="check-event-mesh-progress"/>Checking the Progress of an Event Mesh</h2>
    <p>The process to create, update, or delete an event mesh takes up to five minutes. The time varies based on various factors (e.g., size of the event mesh, the cloud providers and regions of your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>, network connectivity speeds). When you choose to create, update, or delete an event mesh, you get a brief notification on the page to indicate that the operation has started. To check on the progress of the operation, you can navigate to the event mesh and see its status. You may need to refresh the view or discover  the event mesh if you've just created it. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#scan-for-new-mesh">Scanning and Refreshing for New Event Meshes</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>For example, if you started creating an event, you can select <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager"/> from the navigation bar in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>, and on the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager" style="font-weight: bold;"/><b>: Event Meshes</b> page, you can see the creation progress of the event mesh as shown below:</p>
    <p>
      <div class="thumbnail-container">
        <img class="solacethumbnail" src="../../Resources/Images/Mesh_Manager/creating_progression.png" alt=""/>
      </div>
    </p>
    <h2><a name="scan-for-new-mesh"/>Discover New Event Meshes</h2>
    <p>You may have manually created an event mesh or have existing event meshes that you've created that aren't shown. You can discover these meshes by performing a scan that refreshes your view of event meshes in your account (Workspace). To do this, use the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Cloud/Task_UI_Snippets/login_console.flsnp"/>
      </li>
      <li> Select <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager" style="font-weight: bold;"/> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/navbar_mesh_manager.png" class="img-img-inline" alt=""/> from the navigation bar.</li>
      <li>
        <p>On the <b>Mesh Manager: Event Meshes</b> page, click  <b>Mesh Actions</b><img src="../../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/more_actions_ellipsis.png" class="img.img-inline" alt=""/> beside the <b>Create Mesh</b> link and select <b>Scan for Event Meshes</b>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>After a few minutes, the cards representing the event meshes refresh. If an event mesh  is in the process of being created, updated, or deleted, you can see its progress. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#check-event-mesh-progress"> Check Progress of an Event Mesh</MadCap:xref>. </p>
    <h2><a name="reresh-view"/>Refreshing the View for an Event Mesh</h2>
    <p>After you create, add, or remove links from an event mesh, you can  refresh the visual representation for the  event mesh. To do so,  you can run a scan to refresh your view of your event mesh to see any  link or topology changes to your event mesh. Only a single scan can occur at one time. To refresh the view for your event mesh, use these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/Cloud/Task_UI_Snippets/login_console.flsnp"/>
      </li>
      <li> Select <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager" style="font-weight: bold;"/> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/navbar_mesh_manager.png" class="img-img-inline" alt=""/> from the navigation bar.</li>
      <li>
        <p>On the <b><b>Mesh Manager: Event Meshes</b></b> page, on the card for the event mesh your want to refresh, click  <b>Mesh Actions</b><img src="../../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/more_actions_ellipsis.png" class="img.img-inline" alt=""/>, and in the menu, select one ways to refresh the links:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Scan Event Mesh</b> to refresh the links on the </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>View Details</b> and then on the <b>Mesh Map</b> page, click <b>Mesh Actions</b><img src="../../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/more_actions_ellipsis.png" class="img.img-inline" alt=""/>, and then click <b>Scan Event Mesh</b></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>As the scan occurs, updates to the visual representation of your mesh appear. A <b>Scan completed</b> notification pop-up notification appears on the bottom of the page and you may need to refresh your web page to see the changes reflected in the user interface.</p>
    <h2><a name="view-event-mesh-details"/>Viewing the Event Mesh and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/> Details</h2>
    <p>There are a number of views that you can use to find out information about your event mesh and services in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager"/>. Event meshes that are available appear in  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.mesh_manager"/> on the <b>Mesh Manager: Event Meshes </b> page. You  can see the status of an event mesh see details about the event mesh and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> details. For example, on the event mesh card, you can see that it's Healthy because all the links are up and the status shows green:</p>
