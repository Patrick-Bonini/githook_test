    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Deleting an Event Mesh</h1>
    <p>You can delete an event mesh. Deleting an event mesh removes the connectivity (or links) between each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s themselves are not deleted nor are the services impacted on the individual <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. The impact however  is that events are no longer routed between the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, which may impact  subscribing applications that are trying to get events from publishers that aren't connected to the same <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>.
        </p>
    <p>To delete an event mesh,  you require the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cm_editor"/> role assigned to your user profile in the account where the event mesh exists.  For more information about the role requirements, see <MadCap:xref href="about_event_meshes.htm#considerations-working-with-event-meshes">Considerations for Working with Event Meshes in [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_short%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Before you delete an event mesh, we recommend that you review the considerations when you work with  event meshes. For this information, see <MadCap:xref href="about_event_meshes.htm#considerations-working-with-event-meshes">Considerations for Working with Event Meshes</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>To delete an event mesh, perform the following steps:</p>
