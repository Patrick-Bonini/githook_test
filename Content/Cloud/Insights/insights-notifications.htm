    <h1 MadCap:conditions="Default.ContentProductLink">Understanding Notifications</h1>
    <p> A <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> subscription provides you with the
            ability to enable notifications for managing your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> uses a central monitoring service (Datadog
          , which is a third-party software provider) to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> collect metrics through the use of Datadog agents on the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s</li>
      <li>send notifications for  that occur on  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> that are tracked via monitor events that are triggered. For information about what is monitored, see <MadCap:xref href="Advanced-Monitoring/insights-monitors.htm">[%=Product-Names.insights_long%] Monitors Reference</MadCap:xref>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> By default, notification emails are not enabled. After you enable notification emails, you can configure specific individuals, groups of individuals, or integrate with third-party applications   to receive notifications. Furthermore, you configure who receives the notifications based on the severity level  of the email notification.
 </p>
    <p>For information about :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>email notifications, including severity levels and emails, see <MadCap:xref href="#notification-emails-severity">About Email Notifications and Severity Levels</MadCap:xref></li>
      <li> how to configure emails to receive notifications from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/>, see <MadCap:xref href="#managing-notifications">Managing Monitoring and Notifications</MadCap:xref></li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="notification-emails-severity"/>About Email Notifications and Severity Levels</h2>
    <p>When email notifications are enabled, emails are sent that may contain some useful information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> the name of the monitor </li>
      <li>the issue</li>
      <li> a description of the problem</li>
      <li> recommended action (if applicable)</li>
      <li>the severity; for more information about severity levels, see <MadCap:xref href="#notification-severity">Notification Severity</MadCap:xref></li>
      <li>time and date of the problem</li>
      <li>details of the affected <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> (service name, organization, current threshold)</li>
      <li>links to related logs (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When logs are  available, some of the information list above is in the log itself rather than in the email.</p>
    <p class="Note">The links in the notification email  are only accessible if the user has been granted the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_manager"/>, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_editor"/>,  or <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_viewer"/> role in the account for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short" MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"/><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapOnlyOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_firstuse"/></MadCap:conditionalText>. </p>
    <p> Emails can be sent to the an individual, a group of people, or to an application. For more information on the differences, see <MadCap:xref href="#types-emails">Types of Emails</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of the notification email with the severity level of Alert when the Queue for Guaranteed
            Messages rises above 95% of the capacity:</p>

      </div>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="types-emails"/>Types of Emails</h3>
    <p>Email notifications can be sent to an individual user, a group users, or a third-party notification-based applicatios (<a href="#email-integrations" class="link-internal">application email integration</a>). The three types of email addresses you can use are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Individual</b> — This email would be one person, such as person1@example.com.</li>
      <li><b>Group</b> — This  email is sent to an email server that distributes the email to multiple people. For example, <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Links.CompanySupportEmail"/>.</li>
      <li><b>Application</b> —This email that is used to integrate with a third-party application. Typically these applications are notification-based platforms take the email notifications and turn them into incidents to consolidate and centralize notifications with an organization's workflows or notification systems. For example, may receive a text message, pager notification, assigned a ticket, etc. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#email-integrations">Integrating Notifications with Applications</MadCap:xref>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="notification-severity"/>Severity Levels of Email Notifications</h3>
    <p>The email notifications are sent based on the three severity levels and are triggered based on the configured monitor event. For information about monitor events, see <MadCap:xref href="#managing-notifications">Managing Monitoring and Notifications</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>The s severity levels are as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Alerts</b> — The highest severity of monitor events related to resource utilization or service interruptions. This notification indicates that the specified threshold as a percentage (e.g., 95%) of the available capacity has been reached; alternatively, it can also indicate that a status change has occurred. Some alerts often indicate a serious error where <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are about to be unavailable  or non-operational. When an alert notification maps to this threshold level, action should be taken to remediate the issue as a service interruption may have occurred or may soon occur. When a log is received, the event occurred; a threshold of say 95% indicates the a service interruption is about to occur.</li>
      <li><b>Warning</b> — A lower-level severity of monitor events related to resource utilization or service interruptions.    This notification indicates that the specified threshold as a percentage (e.g., 80%) of the available capacity has been reached; alternatively, it can also indicate that a status change has occurred as indicated by a log.  These notifications often indicate a more serious problem may or is about to occur if action is not taken.</li>
      <li><b>Recovery</b> — Recovery notifications follow when the related Alert or Warning notification favorably changes status or drops below a threshold. For example, if you had received an Alert that indicated that the metric level had reached 95%, you'll get a corresponding Recovery notification when the metric level goes back below 95%. For alerts and warnings notifications that are created due to a status change as indicate by a log, a CLEAR log event would have been received. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The standard notifications are grouped into the following categories and utilize these <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> monitors:</p>

    <h2 MadCap:conditions="Default.ContentProductLink"><a name="email-integrations"/>Integrating Notifications with Applications</h2>
    <p>You can integrate notifications from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/>   with various third-party notification-based applications, such as service desk, incident management, or incident response applications. </p>
    <p>These integrations are currently possible if there is email integration available in the notification-based application. Email notification integration is  a common workflow that is used to leverage notifications with notification-based applications to drive actions (or workflows) within an organization. For example, the email notifications can be used to create service tickets, manage user notifications (i.e., capture volumes of notifications to reduce notification fatigue or drive notice and escalation workflows).</p>
    <p>The typical high-level workflow to integrate with email notifications with a notification-based application is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Get a target email address from the notification-based application and add it to the list of emails in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_short"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#enabling-notifications-for-your-account">Enabling Notifications for Your Account</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Within the notification-based application, configure how the emails are treated and the workflow that is triggered based on the email notification.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For example, these  notification-based platforms have information about how to integrate emails that are received to trigger workflows and actions:</p>
