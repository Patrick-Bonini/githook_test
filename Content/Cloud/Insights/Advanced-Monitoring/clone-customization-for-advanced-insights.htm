    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Extending Advanced Monitoring</h1>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> provides <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/>, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/>, and metrics that are valuable for general use cases whether you're in an operations and integration, or applications support team. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> are based on core best practices from subject-matter-experts and feedback from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> community. You may want to extend the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> Advanced Monitoring capabilities to adapt them to match your specific use cases or requirements. </p>
    <p>If you have the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_manager" style="font-weight: bold;"/> or <b><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_editor"/></b> role, you can do one or more of following to accomplish this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create your own <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/> and then copy widgets from an existing dashboard to add to yours. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/#new-dashboard" target="_blank" title="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/#new-dashboard" alt="https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/#new-dashboard" class="link-offsite">New Dashboard</a> in the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.datadoghq.com/" alt="https://docs.datadoghq.com/" class="link-offsite">Datadog documentation</a>.</li>
      <li>Clone any of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> to use as a starting point and then add and remove widgets to suite your monitoring requirements. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#clone-dashboards">Cloning Existing Dashboards for Reuse.</MadCap:xref></li>
      <li>On a cloned board or one that you create, you can create custom views,  add custom or existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/>, add custom widgets, customize existing widgets, and create filters. For more information, see the following sections:<ul><li><MadCap:xref href="#create-custom-view">Creating Custom Views</MadCap:xref></li><li><MadCap:xref href="#create-custom-filters">Creating Filters </MadCap:xref></li></ul><p>For example, you could clone all of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> and then add filters to the widgets on the dashboard to reflect the needs of your team. To make it easier to access, you could also ask users to add them as favorites in their Datadog account.</p></li>
      <li>Create custom monitors and clone existing monitors to customize them. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#create-custom-monitors">Creating Custom Monitors.</MadCap:xref></li>
      <li>Mute monitors whose default thresholds don't meet your needs, or to limit the amount of notifications you receive from specific monitor types, see <MadCap:xref href="#Mute">Muting Monitors</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Schedule downtime for monitors. This allows you to turn of notification from specific, or all monitors for a time a specified time, once or on a recurring schedule. This is useful feature to manage notification during maintenance, or upgrades. See <MadCap:xref href="#Schedule">Schedule Downtime</MadCap:xref>.</li>

    <h2><a name="clone-dashboards"/>Cloning Existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_capital_case"/> for Reuse</h2>
    <p>It is possible that your business has its own unique requirements, but  you may find that a small modification to one of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/> may help optimize its use.  The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> provided by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> cannot be modified. For your organization, if you need to modify a dashboard, we recommend that you clone one of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> and adapt it as required.</p>
    <p class="Note">Do not put any cloned dashboards that you create into any lists that have <code>Solace</code> or <code>Insights</code> in the name. This could cause changes to occur to your dashboard during upgrades or content changes that are done by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>.</p>
    <p>Before you cloning <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/>, it's a good idea to become familiar with how to create and modify dashboards in Datadog. In addition to cloning, you can also create your dashboards and then add metrics and monitors to your dashboard. In either case, here are some suggested topics to help you get started with dashboards in  the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.datadoghq.com/" alt="https://docs.datadoghq.com/" class="link-offsite">Datadog documentation</a>:</p>

    <h3><a name="create-custom-monitors"/>Creating Custom Monitors</h3>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> provides predefined <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/> that you can use on your dashboards; however, you may want to create a custom monitor of your own or clone and customize an existing  monitor. If you want to create your own monitor, you can base it off any metric or log that is parsed already as a monitor in your account; cloning an existing monitor simply accelerates the process of creating your own custom monitor. An example of cloning and customizing a monitor can be found in <MadCap:xref href="#Cloning">Cloning and Customizing the Template Monitor</MadCap:xref> below.</p>
    <p>There are different  types of monitors available that include status-based, log-based, and metric-based monitors. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> also provides a sample template monitor which is not picked up (or used) by the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/>, which you can use to create custom monitors. The template monitor has the <code>solace_customizable_template</code> tag to distinguish it from the other monitors provided with insights that are active. Custom monitors that you create are picked up in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> provided with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> when they have the  <code>custom_insights</code> tag. This aspect is particularly useful when you use the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> to monitor your estate and you want custom monitors to appear on any <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/>.</p>
    <p>To understand how to clone a monitor, see cloning monitors, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" alt="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" class="link-offsite">Manage Monitors</a> in the Datadog documentation, but ensure that you follow the guidelines listed below in this section. Not adhering to the guidelines that we describe in this section  can impair <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>'s ability to properly manage your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and cause inconsistencies in the monitoring data reported in the dashboards.</p>
    <p>The provided template monitor contains a brief outline explaining how to clone and configuring your own monitor. To understand how to clone and configure a monitor, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Manage Monitors</a> in the Datadog documentation. While you can also clone and configure based on other monitors, you must ensure that you follow the guidelines listed below in this section. Not adhering to the guidelines can impair <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>'s ability to properly manage your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and cause inconsistencies in the monitoring data reported in the dashboards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> You can clone any  monitors that have been tagged with <code>solace_insights</code>, however, if a monitor has the tag  <code>solace_rmms</code>, <b>DO NOT clone it</b>.<p class="Warning">There are risks and consequences to cloning the monitors that are tagged with <code>solace_rmms</code>. Incorrectly cloning these monitors in your account can impair <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>'s ability to properly manage your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, which may result in degradation of service. If you clone any monitors that clearly indicate not to copy, it can result in you temporarily losing access to your Datadog account and all changes in your Datadog account being reset.</p></li>
      <li>After you have cloned a monitor, remove the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>-specific tags (<code>solace-*</code>), such as <code>solace-insights</code> and <code>solace_customizable _template</code>, so that it prevents your cloned monitor from being modified or removed during upgrades or content refreshes.<ul><li>The sample template monitor is meant for you to clone as a template and is not actively used (or picked up in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/>). Only sample template monitors have the <code>solace_customizable_template</code> tag. If you clone a template monitor, ensure that you remove the <code>solace_customizable_template</code> from the cloned monitor.
                    </li></ul></li>
      <li>If you want a custom monitor to be picked up in by the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/>, you must add the <code>custom_insights</code> tag to the monitor.</li>
      <li> Using the provided sample template monitor is recommended, but if you clone an active monitor, there are a few caveats to consider:<ul><li>you get the notifications from the original <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>-provided monitor as well as the notification from the cloned monitor that you created</li><li>if you add <code>custom_insights</code> to a cloned monitor, it can result in both monitors appearing in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/></li></ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information about cloning monitors, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" alt="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/manage_monitor/" class="link-offsite">Manage Monitors</a> in the Datadog documentation.</p>
    <h4><a name="Cloning"/>Cloning and Customizing the Template Monitor
        </h4>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> provides a sample template monitor that you can clone and customize to create your own custom monitors that log metrics that are of importance to your organization. With the custom template monitor you can define the event logs to monitor, the alert conditions, who is notified when those conditions are met, and what message they receive.</p>
    <p class="Note">The template monitor is provided as is to enable you to create your own monitors. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> does not offer or provide support for monitors created using the custom template monitor.
        </p>
    <p>In the procedure below, we create a new monitor that notifies us when a client is having connectivity issues. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>In Datadog, on the Monitors page select the Manage Monitors tab, and enter <code>solace_customizable_template</code> in the search field to find the customizable template monitor.
            <p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/Datadog_find_template.png" alt="Image displaying an example of the sample template monitor"/></p></li>
      <li>Select the <b>Sample template for broker event log monitors</b> by clicking on its name in the <b>Name</b> column.</li>
      <li>To clone the template monitor click the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_config.png" alt=""/> icon in the top right corner and select <b>Clone</b>.
				<p>The cloned template monitor opens in edit mode <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">(indicated by the blue underscore under the word Edit in the top right corner)</MadCap:conditionalText>(indicated by the breadcrumb ending with <b>configuration</b> in the top left corner). You can now define your monitors new parameters.</p><p><div class="thumbnail-container"><img class="solacethumbnail" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/Configure_cloned_monitor.png" alt="Image displaying an example of the cloned monitor open for editing"/></div></p></li>
      <li>In section 1, click in the field at the top to define your search query. For example, enter <code>event:SYSTEM_CLIENT_CONNECT_FAIL</code> as your search query. </li>
      <ul>
        <li> For a complete list of event logs you can use, see the <MadCap:xref href="insights-monitors.htm#Event">Event log descriptions</MadCap:xref>. </li>
        <li>For information about syntax, see the <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/search_syntax/" class="link-offsite">Log Search Syntax</a> section in the Datadog documentation. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Next you can define the criteria that triggers the monitor. For example, you can define the Count. To do this, click on the field to the right of the <b>group by</b> and select <code>service_name(service_name)</code> and <code>client_username(@client_username)</code> from the drop-down list. Whenever this unique combination appears in our selected logs, a notification is triggered.
            <p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/CustomMonitor_Sec1.png" alt="Image displaying the Defint the search query section"/></p></li>
      <li>In section 2, you set the conditions that cause an alert to trigger: You can use the fields in this section to set the thresholds that trigger alerts and warnings. Note that the default values for both the <b>Alert</b> and <b>Warning</b> thresholds are set to unrealistically high values to prevent the monitor from triggering. This prevents Datadog from sending you unnecessary alerts. You should define different thresholds for each which are meaningful for your organization. When defining your thresholds, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> recommends using 1 as a starting point.
				<p><div class="thumbnail-container"><img class="solacethumbnail" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/CustomMonitor_Sec2.png" alt="Image displaying the options in the Set alert conditions section"/></div></p></li>
      <li>In section 3, customize the email that is sent and define tags for the monitor. For the email, you must enter a title. You can also customize the contents of the email, and you can use markdown formatting and variables as required. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/notify/" class="link-offsite">Notifications</a> in the Datadog documentation for more information.

				<p><div class="thumbnail-container"><img class="solacethumbnail" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/CustomMonitor_Notification.png" alt=""/></div></p></li>
      <li>Continuing in section 3, use the field directly below the notification field to enter the email addresses of the people who need to be notified when alert or warning levels are reached. You can use the remaining fields to define when they are notified.
				<p><div class="thumbnail-container"><img class="solacethumbnail" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/CustomMonitor_NotiWho.png" alt=""/></div></p></li>
      <li><b>Optional</b>: Continuing in section 3, you can enable the <b>Renotification</b> toggle to define a second message that is sent if the warning or alarm thresholds persist.<p><div class="thumbnail-container"><img class="solacethumbnail" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/CustomMonitor_Renotification.png" alt=""/></div></p></li>
      <li> Continuing in section 3, you must modify the <b>Tags</b> field located below the <b>Renotification</b> message field toggle. It is critical that you remove the following tags:
            <ul><li><code>solace_insights</code></li><li><code>solace_customizable_templates</code></li><li><code>version:*.*.*</code></li></ul><p>You must then add the <code>custom_insights</code> tag. This prevents your custom monitor from being affected by future updates.</p><p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/CustomMonitor_Tags.png" alt=""/></p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>You have successfully configured a monitor that alerts you whenever a client has issues  connecting to your services.</p>
    <h3><a name="Mute"/><a name="Muting-monitors"/>Muting <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_capital_case"/></h3>
    <p>You can mute <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/>. When a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/> is muted, it continues to trigger on alerts and warnings, but it won't send out notifications. There are numerous reasons you may want to mute  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/>. Perhaps you want to be notified at different thresholds than those set by default. You clone one of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/>, set the thresholds you need, and then mute the original, ensuring you only receive notifications from your customized monitor.</p>
    <p> Muting <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> does not affect <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>'s ability to monitor the operation of your services. However, a muted <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_short"/> should be configured with caution to avoid missing notifications that are relevant to your monitoring needs. You should note that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> provides some proprietary monitors that may not be mutable directly without having the correct roles and permissions. You can mute these monitors by scheduling downtime using their <a href="#MonitorTags" class="link-internal">monitor tags</a>. See <MadCap:xref href="#MutingLockedMonitors">Muting Locked [%=Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_capital_case%] Using Downtime</MadCap:xref> for more details.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In Datadog, go to <b>Monitors</b> &gt; <b>Manage Monitors</b> to access the list of monitors. You may have to toggle the <b>False</b> setting  flag under the <b>Active</b> filter to the left of the table to see a full list of available downtimes.</li>
      <li>Select the monitor you want to mute by clicking it in the list.</li>
      <li>Click on the gear icon <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_config.png" alt="Gear icon"/> in the top right corner and select <b>Clone</b> from the menu that opens.</li>
      <p>The monitor is cloned and opens in configuration mode, which should be familiar from <MadCap:xref href="#clone-dashboards">Cloning Existing [%=Product-Names.insights_default_dash_capital_case%] for Reuse</MadCap:xref> if you have previously cloned monitors. </p>
      <li>Scroll down to section <b>2</b><b>- Set Alert Conditions</b> and alter the conditions so that the monitor only triggers notifications according to your requirements. At least one condition must be configured differently than those existing in the original monitor or you won't be allowed to save the cloned monitor.
            <p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_mute_section3.png" alt="Image displaying the Set alert conditions options in Datadog"/></p></li>
      <li>Once the thresholds are configured, click <b>Save</b> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
      <li>The cloned monitor closes and you are returned to the original monitor. A <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_mute.png" alt="Mute button"/> icon becomes available next to the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_config.png" alt="Gear icon"/> icon in the top right corner. Click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_mute.png" alt="Mute button"/> to open the mute options.
Note that some monitors can't be muted this way, see <MadCap:xref href="#MutingLockedMonitors">Muting Locked [%=Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_capital_case%] Using Downtime</MadCap:xref>  for more details.<p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_mute_options.png" alt="Image displaying the Mute options window"/></p></li>
      <li>Set your mute options. In most cases, you can set the mute to forever. This  ensures you don't receive duplicate notifications from both monitors, and are only notified according to the thresholds you have configured for the monitor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Quickly Mute and Unmute Monitors</h4>
    <p>You can quickly mute and unmute <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/> directly from the list of Monitors using the quick mute icon <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_quick_mute_icon.png" alt="quick mute icon"/>. </p>
    <p>
      <img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_quick_mute.png" alt="Image disdplaying the location of the Quick Mute button"/>
    </p>
    <p>Muting a monitor this way does so for an indefinite time period. You should note that muting monitors this way generally won't work for proprietary [Insights] monitors, see <MadCap:xref href="#MutingLockedMonitors">Muting Locked [%=Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_capital_case%] Using Downtime</MadCap:xref> for details.</p>
    <h4><a name="MutingLockedMonitors"/>Muting Locked <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_capital_case"/> Using Downtime</h4>
    <p>You may encounter some <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/> that appear to be locked to even users with the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_manager"/> or <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_editor"/> role. These locked <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/> are generally proprietary monitors provided by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>. You can see if a monitor is locked by selecting it from the monitor list and scrolling to the <b>Define permissions and audit notifications</b> section of the monitor. A locked monitor displays a statement similar to 'This monitor is locked: only its create and admins can edit it.'</p>
    <p>
      <img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_permissions_lockedby.png" alt="Image displaying an example of how a locked monitor appears in the Define permission and audit notifications section"/>
    </p>
    <p>If the monitor is locked, it can still be muted by scheduling a downtime using its tags, see <MadCap:xref href="#Schedule">Scheduling Downtime</MadCap:xref>. </p>
    <h3><a name="Schedule"/>Scheduling Downtime</h3>
    <p>Downtime for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> monitors can be scheduled in Datadog. A scheduled downtime allows monitors to be muted for a scheduled start time and duration. This is useful if you are planning upgrades or other work that may trigger notifications from the various Datadog monitors. Perhaps you have a datacenter that has a maintenance scheduled on a specific weekday every week, causing notifications to be sent whenever the maintenance is occurring, you can schedule a downtime for that period, muting notification for that time. Once scheduled downtimes have been created, you can later edit, clone, or cancel them, see <MadCap:xref href="#Edit,">Edit, Clone, or Cancel a Scheduled Downtime</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Scheduling downtime does not affect the ability of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to monitor your services.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In Datadog, go to <b>Monitors</b> &gt; <b>Manage Downtimes</b> to access the list of currently scheduled downtimes.
            <p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_downtime_list.png" alt="Image showing location of Schedule Downtime button on Manage Downtimes tab of Monitor screen in Datadog"/></p></li>
      <li>Click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/schedule_downtime.png" alt="schedule downtime icon"/> to open the Schedule Downtime window.</li>
      <li>In step 1, choose the monitor to silence. You can select to schedule downtime for monitors by their Monitor Name or Monitor Tags using the <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_ByName_ByTag_toggle.png" alt="Example of the By Monitor Name, By Monitor Tags toggle button"/> toggle in the top of the section:
            <ul><li>Selecting By Monitor Name displays the <b>Monitor</b> field where monitors can be selected from a list, or entered if the monitor name is known.</li><li><a name="MonitorTags"/>Selecting By Monitor Tags displays the <b>Monitor Tag</b> field where tags can be selected from a list, or entered if the tag name is known. Tags are attached to monitors and can be viewed by selecting a monitor and viewing its TAGS section.<div lass="thumbnail-container"><p><img class="img-border" src="../../../Resources/Images/Insights/datadog_monitor_tag_location.png" alt="Image displaying the location of TAGS for a selected monitor"/></p></div></li><li>You can also mute by scope such as <code>service_id:some_id</code> or <code>queue_name:some_queue_name</code> using the <b>Group Scope</b> fields. </li><li>Select  <b>Preview Affected Monitors</b> to see a preview of the monitors that are affected by your selections </li></ul></li>
      <li>In step 2, configure the schedule for the downtime. Downtimes can be one time events, or reoccurring. You can also specify the day, start time, and end time for the downtime. </li>
      <li>In step 3, define a message that is sent to notify people about the scheduled downtime when it occurs. You can enter emails of the people to notify using @handle notation or select them from the menu in step 4. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><a name="Edit,"/>Edit, Clone, or Cancel a Scheduled Downtime</h4>
    <p>Once you have created scheduled downtimes, you can edit, clone, or cancel them as required. </p>
    <ol>

    <h3><a name="create-custom-view"/>Creating Custom Views</h3>
    <p>The default view for a dashboard  shows everything in a predefined time interval  without an filters applied. You may want to create different views to give you different contexts for the information on your dashboard, which can be useful for troubleshooting or analyzing your estate. </p>
    <p>When you apply data or time filters to a view, that filtering isn't saved. If you want to save the view based on your filtering choices, click the <b>Saved Views</b> drop-down list and enter a new name for your view. You'll notice an URL is created. That URL can be used  to return to the view with your filters applied. The  saved view is also now accessible from the <b>Saved Views</b> drop-down list.</p>
    <p>For more information about managing custom views, see <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/saved_views/" target="_blank" title="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/saved_views/" alt="https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/saved_views/" class="link-offsite">Saved Views</a> in the Datadog documentation.</p>
    <h3><a name="create-custom-filters"/>Creating Filters </h3>
    <p>In addition to the some of predefined filters that are provided on the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/>, you can also create your own filters. To do this, you create a <i>Template Variable</i> to create additional filters. These template variables can give you different views the data  to help you better understand different aspects of your estate. Here's a quick overview of how to do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the dashboard, click the <b>Edit</b> beside the <code>$service_name</code>.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Add Variable</b>. </li>
      <li>In the <b>Name</b> field, enter a name for your variable.
			</li>
      <li>In the next <b>Tag or Attribute</b> field for you new variable, select the tag or attribute to use as a filter.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Select a value for the <b>Default Value</b> field. The default is to use <code>*</code> (all).</li>
      <li>Click <b>Done</b> or repeat steps 2 to 5 until you have created all your variables. </li>
    </ol>
