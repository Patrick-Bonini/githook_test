        <p>User permissions must be mapped only to the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_viewer"/> and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_editor"/> roles.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You are responsible for managing the expiry of your SAML metadata file and must request that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> update the file at least one month before its expiry date. </p>
