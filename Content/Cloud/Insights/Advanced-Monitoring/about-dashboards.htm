    <h2><a name="last-value-explain"/>About Last Values in Metrics in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> Dashboards</h2>
    <p>It is important to note that if the title of a widget in the dashboard is prefixed by the word ‘<b>last</b>’, the value shown is the last value collected by the metric at the end of the selected timeframe. For example, you selected the last hour as the timeframe, and the Last Services metric shows a value of 2. That value comes from the  last time the metric was updated for that one hour time frame. The value is not an average of the timeframe, or derived from a timeframe's total.</p>

    <p>The Message Flow Trends dashboard expands on the Message Flow Overview dashboard. The Message Flow Trends dashboard  shows trends for the messaging activity through the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s for the following metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>incoming messages</li>
      <li>Guaranteed Messages in the Message Spools</li>
      <li>outgoing messages</li>
      <li>discarded messages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This dashboard also shows the status of all the message related monitors and gives you an overall sense of message flow and answer questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are things being observed the result of a sudden change or a gradual movement?</li>
      <li>Are there recurring cycles that I should watch? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Application Support teams often use this dashboard to dig a little deeper and explore how the metrics have changed over and interval of time.</p>

    <p>When this dashboard is not filtered by service, some of the trend line charts show the percentage utilization by service as specified in the titles - one line per service.</p>
    <p>Each object on the dashboard can be expanded to see more context. You can interact with the various widgets</p>
    <p>The top section is a brief overview of metrics that are useful to understand the capacity of your estate. On this dashboard, there are percentage utilization metrics that reflect the current value as a percent of the limit for that resource for your selected service. The line graphs have thresholds showing at 80% (the warn threshold for most monitors) and 95% (the alert threshold for most monitors).</p>

This dashboard provides an overview of bridges in your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s.</p>
    <p>This dashboard gives you an overall sense of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> usage and answer questions such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the operational status of my bridges?</li>
      <li>Are messages flowing smoothly across my bridges?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Application Support teams often use this dashboard to analyze bridge usage, identify potential issues with bridges, and to identify whether additional investigation is required.</p>

    <h3><a name="bridges-details"/>Details of the Bridges Overview Dashboard</h3>
    <p>The top section is a brief overview of the number of bridges, messages sent and received over the bridges, and the Bridge Monitor Count and Status. The metrics provide an overview of messages across the bridges in your estate that include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>all incoming and outgoing messages with a view of direct, persistent, and non-persistent metrics</li>
      <li>all incoming and outgoing discards</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>Here’s a description of the components of this dashboard:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Bridges</b>: A Query Value widget that shows the status of bridges in the estate.</li>
      <li><b>Total Messages Sent</b>: A query value widget that shows the total messages sent by clients over the bridge.</li>
      <li><b>Total Messages Received</b>: A query value widget that shows the total messages received by clients over the bridge.</li>
      <li><b>Bridge Monitor Counts &amp; Status</b>: A monitor summary widget that represents the number of VPN-scoped monitors watching your bridges (not the number of alerts or warnings). The Alert overview is a histogram of alerts for the selected time period. The <b>Alert/Warn </b>number is the number of monitors that have Alerts or Warning states, and <b>OK </b>is the number of monitors in the OK state. The table that’s below the <b>Alert/Warn </b>and <b>OK </b>numbers is a list of monitors and the count of the instances of that monitor triggered in various states - Alert, Warn, OK.</li>
      <li><b>Incoming Messages</b>: A section that shows the rates of different incoming messages over the bridge, graph, and the high water mark (HWM) for the timeframe selected.<ul><li>Last Msgs In Rate: A query value widget that shows the last incoming message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges.<ul><li>Incoming Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the incoming message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Msgs In Rate: A Query Value widget that shows the highest value for the incoming message rate for the time interval selected.</li></ul></li><li>Last Direct Msgs In Rate: A query value widget that shows the last incoming Direct message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges.<ul><li>Incoming Direct Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the incoming Direct message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Direct Msgs In Rate: A Query Value widget that shows the highest value for the incoming Direct message rate for the time interval selected.</li></ul></li><li>Last Persistent Msgs In Rate: A query value widget that shows the last incoming Persistent message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges. <ul><li>Incoming Persistent Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the incoming Persistent message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Persistent Msgs In Rate: A Query Value widget that shows the highest value for the incoming Persistent message rate for the time interval selected. </li></ul></li><li>Last Non-Persistent Msgs In Rate: A query value widget that shows the last incoming Non-Persistent message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges. <ul><li>Incoming Non-Persistent Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the incoming Non-Persistent message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Non-Persistent Msgs In Rate: A Query Value widget that shows the highest value for the incoming Non-Persistent message rate for the time interval selected. </li></ul></li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Outgoing Messages</b>: A section that shows the rates of different outgoing messages over the bridge, graph, and the high water mark (HWM) for the timeframe selected.<ul><li>Last Msgs Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the last outgoing message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges.<ul><li>Incoming Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the outgoing message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Msgs Out Rate: A Query Value widget that shows the highest value for the outgoing message rate for the time interval selected.</li></ul></li><li>Last Direct Msgs Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the last outgoing Direct message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges.<ul><li>Outgoing Direct Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the outgoing Direct message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Direct Msgs Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the highest value for the outgoing Direct message rate for the time interval selected.</li></ul></li><li>Last Persistent Msgs Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the last outgoing Persistent message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges. <ul><li>Outgoing Persistent Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the outgoing Persistent message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Persistent Msgs Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the highest value for the outgoing Persistent message rate for the time interval selected. </li></ul></li><li>Last Non-Persistent Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the last outgoing Non-Persistent message rate (messages per second) on the selected bridges. <ul><li>Outgoing Non-Persistent Message Rate on Bridges (msgs/sec): A Timeseries Widget that shows a graph of the outgoing Non-Persistent message rate (messages per second) over the selected time interval. </li><li>HWM Non-Persistent Msgs Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the highest value for the outgoing Non-Persistent message rate for the time interval selected. </li></ul></li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Incoming Discards</b>: A section that shows the incoming message discarded by the bridges.<ul><li>Last Discards In: A query value widget that shows the last number of incoming messages that were discarded by the bridges.</li><li>Last Discards In Rate: A query value widget that shows the last rate (messages per second) of incoming messages that were discarded by the bridges.</li><li>Bridge Incoming Discards Rate (msgs/sec): A Timeseries widget that shows a graph of the rate (messages per second) of incoming messages that were discarded by the bridges over the selected time interval. </li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Outgoing Discards</b>: A section that shows the outgoing messages discarded by the bridges. <ul><li>Last Discards Out: A query value widget that shows the last number of outgoing messages that were discarded by the bridges.</li><li>Last Discards Out Rate: A query value widget that shows the last rate (messages per second) of outgoing messages that were discarded by the bridges.</li><li>Bridge Outgoing Discards Rate (msgs/sec): A Timeseries widget that shows a graph of the rate (messages per second) of outgoing messages that were discarded by the bridges over the selected time interval. </li></ul></li>
      <li><b>Bridges</b>: A Table widget that lets you look at the current state of key metrics by bridges. The table includes detailed information about the incoming/outgoing messages rates and incoming/outgoing discard rates by bridge name. You can also use the <b>Search </b>to filter on the name of the Bridge (<code>BRIDGE_NAME</code>). Alternatively, you can use the filters at the top of this dashboard to filter what is shown in the tables.</li>
