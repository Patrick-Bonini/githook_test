An <i>estate</i> refers to your deployment of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, the messaging and activities that occur, and any capabilities that are part of your <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapOnlyOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_firstuse"/></MadCap:conditionalText> account (Workspace). <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> helps you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your applications and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s running optimally as key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and events let you understand performance, usage, and proactively detect and address issues in your event-driven architecture (EDA).</li>
      <li>Better understand application behavior and size your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s from one place. You can see misconfigurations, understand how events flow between applications,  better  monitor your applications, and understand the performance of your EDA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>See visualizations that include account-level dashboards, service-level dashboards, and access to advanced monitoring with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/>. For advanced monitoring, you can also create custom monitors and dashboards to align with your organization's monitoring requirements.

    <h2><a name="logs-metrics"/>Logs and Metrics</h2>
    <p>Central to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> are the hundreds of metrics and many log files (system, command, and event logs) from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s that are collected. These metrics and logs are used by the many <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/> that are provided as part of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> that map to key-performance indicators and best-practices for monitoring <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and event-driven architectures. Datadog, a third-party, centralized monitoring service, handles the collection and storage of metrics and logs.</p>
    <p class="Note">Though you could use the <a href="../cloud-syslog-forwarding.htm" class="link-internal">Syslog Forwarding</a> feature available in our platform  to forward all of the logs to process and visualize the information in your own monitoring system, it won't include the many metrics and monitors that <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> provides. You may find that using <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> provides deeper monitoring capabilities that complement your existing monitoring system.</p>
    <p>With <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/>, logs and metrics are accessible from a set of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_dash_long"/> to permit you to view a log  for up to 30 days (90 days upon request). You can search metrics based on relevant tags. </p>
    <p>For example, with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/>, you can view the logs collected from your estate directly as shown below from the <MadCap:xref href="Advanced-Monitoring/about-dashboards.htm#estate-overview">Estate Overview</MadCap:xref> dashboard. </p>

    </p>
    <p>The collected metrics contain derived and statistical information from the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s in your estate. You can further investigate the metrics within Datadog by navigating to <b>Metrics</b> &gt; <b>Summary</b> and then clicking on a metric, as illustrated below: </p>

      <a name="monitors"/>
      <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_capital_case"/>
    </h2>
    <p>Along with the metrics and logs, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> includes pre-created <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_long"/>. There are over 50 monitors available with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> and these monitors provide you with pre-canned best practices for event monitoring. The best practices leverage knowledge from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>'s broad customer base and from subject-matter experts  so that you can effectively manage your event-drive architecture. </p>
    <p>These are the basic types of monitors available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Log-based</b> — These monitors evaluate key logs from the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and are triggered when those specific logs are seen.</li>
      <li><b>Metric-based</b> — These monitors evaluate metrics collected from the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and are triggered based on thresholds. These monitors measure utilization as a percentage of available capacity.</li>
      <li><b>Status-based</b> — These monitors evaluate status. This can be simple status of whether something is up or down or they may be derived.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/> are pre-configured with thresholds to send alerts and warnings. You can clone the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/> and then change them (e.g., modify the thresholds) to create customized monitors of your own. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> also provides a template monitor which you can clone and customize in order to monitor specific information relevant to your business. Users can see the monitors in the Monitors page in  their Datadog account when they have the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_manager" style="font-weight: bold;"/>, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_editor" style="font-weight: bold;"/>, or <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_adv_viewer" style="font-weight: bold;"/> role assigned as a role, as shown here:</p>

    <p>For information about <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_default_monitor_short"/> and customizing monitors, see <MadCap:xref href="Advanced-Monitoring/insights-monitors.htm">[%=Product-Names.insights_long%] Monitors Reference </MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="Advanced-Monitoring/clone-customization-for-advanced-insights.htm#create-custom-monitors">Creating Custom Monitors</MadCap:xref>, respectively.</p>
    <h2><a name="Troubleshoot"/>Debug and Troubleshoot with Event Logs</h2>
    <p>The combination of logs, metrics, notifications, and customizable monitors that come with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> provide powerful debugging and troubleshooting tools that can help identify problems you may encounter with your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. With <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/>' access to over <a href="Advanced-Monitoring/insights-monitors.htm#Event" class="link-internal">30 additional event related logs</a> you can be sure that you have the tools you need to monitor a wide array of events that may occur with your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s within your <i>estate</i>. </p>
    <p>For example, you have setup a new <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>, but your clients appear to be having problems connecting to it. Worse, you only find out after hours or days. You can use the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> access to Datadog and search the logs. There you may find the <code>SYSTEM_CLIENT_CONNECT_FAIL</code> event show up in the logs, after the fact. </p>
    <p>
      <div class="thumbnail-container">
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Insights/EventLogSearch_ClientConnectFail.png" class="solacethumbnail" alt="Screenshot showing an example as described by the surrounding text."/>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>Clicking on an instance of the event in the log provides information about that instance, allowing you to address the issue. However, with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> Advanced Monitoring, you can be proactive and create a monitor to catch this type of event, or other events that may affect your organization as they occur, allowing you to be informed and address problems proactively when they arise. <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> Advance Monitoring offers a range of events you can monitor, divided into three broad categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client events</li>
      <li>System events</li>
      <li>VPN events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The individual events in each of these categories are detailed in the <MadCap:xref href="Advanced-Monitoring/insights-monitors.htm#Event">Event log descriptions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>After seeing this event show up in your logs you decide to create your own monitor as outlined in <MadCap:xref href="Advanced-Monitoring/clone-customization-for-advanced-insights.htm#Cloning">Cloning and Customizing the Template Monitor
       </MadCap:xref>. Your new monitor is customized to trigger whenever the <code>SYSTEM_CLIENT_CONNECT_FAIL</code> event occurs. Instead of waiting and searching through logs when problems are noticed, you (or the people you choose) are now notified immediately so action can be taken in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>With <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> Advanced Monitoring you can design an array of custom monitors to deal with these events that may affect your organization and it's <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s as they occur. You can be informed immediately when these events happen and troubleshoot them as they arise. </p>
    <h2>Forward <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> Data to Your Own Datadog Account</h2>
    <p>You can forward the metrics and logs collected by the Datadog monitoring agents that are part of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> service to your own Datadog account.
