    <h1>Process to Deploy <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase"/> in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/></h1>
    <p>After your initial overview meeting with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> about installing and deploying <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_long"/></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapOnlyOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_firstuse"/></MadCap:conditionalText>, you follow a five-step process to deploy it.</p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before starting this process ensure that you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to your  account in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. This access is provided to you as part of a Welcome letter that you receive when you purchase <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> Received the Kubernetes requirements from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>. These requirements are determined by the technical staff at <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> based on the <a href="checklist-customer-controlled.htm" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/> Questionnaire</a> you completed when you requested your deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deployment Steps</h3>
    <p>To deploy <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> in your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>, you must coordinate with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to complete a five-step process:</p>

    </p>
    <p class="Tip"><b>Step 5</b> establishes <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.messaging_connectivity"/> and doesn’t impact the installation of the deployment of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> (<MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/>).   This advanced configuration may require multiple levels of approval from your organization’s security and IT teams. Therefore, we recommend that you start this configuration as early as possible.</p>
    <p>The following describes the  five steps in the process shown in the previous diagram:</p>

          <b>Review the Kubernetes Requirements You Received From <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></b>
        </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> sends you the technical requirements for the Kubernetes cluster to install <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> in your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>. You must review these requirements to ensure they can be satisfied. These requirements result from the collaboration between <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> and your technical stakeholders and are also based on your <a href="checklist-customer-controlled.htm" class="link-internal">completed questionnaires</a>. These requirements describe:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>resource sizing and other architectural details for creating your Kubernetes cluster</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>network details such as addresses and ports that must be configured to allow connectivity to various components of your deployment</p>

        <p>(Optional) If your organization requires Single Sign On (SSO), you work with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to enable SSO with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-sso.htm"> [%=Product-Names.console_ui_long%] SSO with OpenID Connect</MadCap:xref>. This step is not a requirement for subsequent steps but is often a requirement for organizations that require SSO for access to any applications.</p>

You run a <a href="installing-ps-cloud-k8s-validate.htm" class="link-internal">validation tool</a> that’s provided by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to ensure that you have correctly configured your Kubernetes cluster. The validation tool lets you know whether your operational and management connectivity is correct. Typically, validation takes less than half an hour. If required, you can <a href="../../get-support.htm" target="_blank" class="link-internal">contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></a> for an understanding of the results from the validation tool.</p>

          <b>Provide Subaccount ID for Each Deployment</b>
        </p>
        <p>On SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform),  create a subaccount. The identifier for the subaccount (or SubAccount ID) is required to start the process for each deployment in your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s (private regions). Each subaccount maps to a Kubernetes cluster. For this reason, even if you have an existing Kubernetes cluster in the same region (or datacenter), you must provide the new subaccount to start this process to create another Kubernetes cluster.
