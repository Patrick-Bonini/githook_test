    <h1>Process to Deploy <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase"/> in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/></h1>
    <p>After your initial overview meeting with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> about installing and deploying <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_long"/></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapOnlyOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_firstuse"/></MadCap:conditionalText>, you follow a four-step process to deploy in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>.</p>
    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before starting this process, ensure that you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to your  account in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. This access is provided to you as part of a Welcome letter that you receive when you purchase <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Received and reviewed the requirements for the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>. These requirements are determined by the technical staff at <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> based on the <a href="checklist-dedicated.htm" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/> Questionnaire</a> you completed when you requested your deployment.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deployment Steps</h3>
    <p>To deploy a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>, you complete a four-step process with the expected timelines as shown in the following diagram . The timelines are based on typical conditions and good coordination between the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> and your organization. </p>

    <p class="Tip"><b>Step 4</b> establishes <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.messaging_connectivity"/> and doesn’t impact the installation of the deployment of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> (<MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/>).   This advanced configuration may require multiple levels of approval from your organization’s security and IT teams. Therefore, we recommend that you start this configuration as early as possible. </p>

        </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> sends the details of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/> and the installation of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> that will be completed for you. You must review these requirements and confirm that they are correct. These requirements result from the collaboration between <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> and your technical stakeholders, and are also based on your <a href="checklist-dedicated.htm" class="link-internal">completed questionnaires</a>. These requirements define:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>the region and architectural details of the Kubernetes cluster in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/></p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>As part of the review, you must confirm:</p>

        <p>(Optional) If your organization requires Single Sign On (SSO), you work with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> to enable SSO with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-sso.htm"> [%=Product-Names.console_ui_long%] SSO with OpenID Connect</MadCap:xref>. This step is not a requirement for subsequent steps but is often a requirement for organizations that require SSO for access to any applications.</p>

This advanced configuration may require multiple levels of approval from your organization’s security and IT teams and that approval or changes are required, this may additional time.

          <b>Provide a Subaccount ID for Each Deployment</b>
        </p>
        <p>On SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform),  you must create a subaccount. The identifier for the subaccount (or SubAccount ID) is required to start the process for each deployment in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>. Each subaccount ID maps to a Kubernetes cluster (or <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>). For this reason, even if you have an existing Kubernetes cluster in the same region (or datacenter), you must provide a new subaccount to start this process to create another Kubernetes cluster. For more information about subaccounts, see <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/account-model#subaccounts" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Account Model</a>.</p>
