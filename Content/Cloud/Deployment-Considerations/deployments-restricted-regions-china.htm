    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Deployments in China</h1>
    <p>Deployments in China require additional considerations due to the business and technical differences when compared to other regions. As such, deployments in China are supported only on Kubernetes,<a href="deployment-options.htm#ownership-model" class="link-internal"> customer-controlled</a> regions. At this time, deployments for  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/>s and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s are not supported in China. The <a href="connectivity-model-k8s.htm" class="link-internal">connectivity</a> for deployments in China for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s  can be public, private, or hybrid. The deployments for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s in China also require that <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/china-network/concepts/icp/" class="link-offsite">you provide a custom domain name registered in China</a> (for example, <code>*.mycompany.cn</code>) with certificates issued for that domain. As such, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s  are accessed using the provided custom domain name rather than <code>*.messaging.solace.cloud</code>.</p>
    <p>Kubernetes clusters are supported on these cloud providers in China:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Azure (AKS). At this time, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployments in China do not have availability zones. For this reason, the IaaS has reduced fault tolerance since it does not support AZs. For more details about this, see <MadCap:xref href="installing-ps-cloud-k8s-aks-specific-req.htm#deployments-restricted-az">Deployments in Regions With No Availability Zones</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). At this time, a separate Amazon China account is required and you must use the Azure China registry for EKS. All information for EKSÂ is stored in the Azure China registry because there is no Amazon China registry available. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="installing-ps-cloud-k8s-eks-specific-req.htm#deployments-china">Considerations for Deployments in China Regions</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes (ACK), see <MadCap:xref href="installing-ps-cloud-k8s-ack-specific-req.htm">Installing [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase%] in Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes Engine (ACK)</MadCap:xref>.</li>
      <li>Huawei Cloud Container Engine (CCE)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On-premises Kubernetes environments are also supported for OpenShift, Rancher (RKE1), and VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG).</p>
