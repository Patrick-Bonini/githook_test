    <p><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_kpi_dashboard"/> in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> displays key performance indicators (KPI) related to your event-driven architecture (EDA) to help you track the performance and efficiency of your EDA.</p>
    <p>The first metric that the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_kpi_dashboard"/> provides is event reuse. <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> analyzes all events created in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/> and imported using <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_rt_event_manager"/> to determine how frequently events are reused in your EDA. Reusing events rather than using two, or more, different events to send the same data from publishers to subscribers improves the efficiency and cost benefit of your EDA.</p>
    <h2><a name="Understanding"/>Understanding the Event Reuse Index</h2>
    <p>An event is considered <i>used</i> whenever it is subscribed to by an application in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/>. The Event Reuse Index is a calculation of the number of application subscriptions to the most recent version of any event in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/>, divided by the total number of events in Designer. The index is calculated separately for events that are shared, which applications in other application domains can subscribe to, and for non-shared events that applications outside of the application domain can't subscribe to.</p>
    <p>For example, if the most recent version of every event in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/> is subscribed to by one application, the Event Reuse Index is 1.0. If you have ten events in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/> and five have two subscribed applications and the other five have only one subscribed application, the Event Reuse Index is 1.5.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Using_KPI"/>Using <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_kpi_dashboard"/></h2>
    <p>When you open the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_kpi_dashboard"/>, it  displays Event Reuse Indexes for both Solace and Kafka events in Designer, along with lists of the 20 most and least used events. You can filter the index and event lists by application domain to compare the reuse index between application domains or development teams.</p>
    <p>To open <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_kpi_dashboard"/>, perform these steps:</p>

      <li>To view the Event Reuse Index and reused event lists for a specific application domain, select the application domain in the <b>Display</b> list. You can also filter the list of events by event broker type, and whether the events are shared.</li>
      <li style="font-weight: normal;">To see more information about an event, click the name of the event. You can click <b>Open in </b><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer" style="font-weight: bold;"/> to open the event  from the <b>Details</b> page.</li>
