    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Terminology for Replication</h1>
    <p>The following terms are used throughout the discussions of and instructions for replication of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Primary Site</dt>
      <dd>For a pair of replication mates, this is the main site and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> that is  has the replication-active status.</dd>
      <dt>Backup Site</dt>
      <dd>For a pair of replication mates, this site often acts as the Standby site and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> that is  has the replication-standby status.</dd>
      <dt>Failed Site</dt>
      <dd>The site that is currently in a bad status due to a disaster. It might be the Active site at the time the disaster occurred. A Restored site is a failed site whose serviced has been recovered. Prior to recovery of the Failed site, the activity has been switched over to the Backup site.</dd>
      <dt>Replication Pair</dt>
      <dd>Refers to two <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s that have the same Message VPN name, typically configured in separate regions, and configured with the replication feature. Each are replication mates of each other.</dd>
      <dt>Replication Mate</dt>
      <dd>Refers the other <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in a replication pair.</dd>
      <dt>Replication-Active</dt>
      <dd>Indicates the active event broker in the context of the Replication feature. This term is used to avoid confusion with active event broker service in a High-Availability Configuration where there is an active event broker and standby event broker.</dd>
      <dt>Replication-Standby</dt>
      <dd>Indicates the standby event broker in the context of the Replication feature. This term is used to avoid confusion with active event broker service in a High-Availability Configuration where there is an active event broker and standby event broker.</dd>
      <dt>Active Site</dt>
      <dd>The Message VPN for an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in  a replication pair that clients connect to for messaging traffic. It has a replication status of <code>active</code>. Generally, the Primary site is the Active site. Depending on the replication status, the Active site can be the Primary site or Backup site. </dd>
      <dt>Standby Site</dt>
      <dd>The Message VPN for an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in a replication pair that is not active and replicates the messages. It has the replication status of <code>standby</code>.  Generally, the Backup site is the Standby site. Depending on the replication status, the Standby site can be the Primary site or Backup site. </dd>
      <dt>
        <span>Redundancy Group</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>A redundancy group is an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> configured with high-availability (HA), which is required to configure replication in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. The group consists of three <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/>s, which are the <i>primary event broker</i>, <i>backup event broker</i>, and <i>monitoring node</i>.  When you are configuring replication, you must use the  router name of the primary event broker. For more information, see <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.NotForPDF"><MadCap:xref href="../ha_concept.htm">High Availability in [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase%]</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlyForPDF"><a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.WebsitePDFLinks%]/Cloud/ha_concept.htm" class="link-offsite">see High Availability in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase"/></a></MadCap:conditionalText>.</dd>
      <dd> The primary event broker provides messaging services to client applications while the backup event broker waits in standby mode. The backup broker only provides service should the primary event broker fail. The monitoring node is a third event broker that acts as a tie-breaker and prevents split-brain scenarios that would otherwise cause both the primary and backup event brokers to be active simultaneously.</dd>
      <dt>Failover</dt>
      <dd>The act of switching activity from one <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> to its replication mate. The failover is complete when the custom hostname is assigned to newly Active site.</dd>
      <dt>Host List</dt>
      <dd>For client applications, a host list specifies the list of hosts to try. When replication is configured for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, the host list should never use the generated names nor the IP addresses of the event broker services. Only the custom hostname for the replication pair must be used.</dd>
      <dt>Custom Hostname</dt>
      <dd>In <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>, you must configure a custom hostname for client applications to use to connect to the replication-Active <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. The custom hostname is an alternate hostname to access the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. When you use the replication feature, you cannot use the system-generated hostnames for failover and we recommend that you do not use the initial generated hostnames for client connections. </dd>
      <dd MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput">
        <p class="Note">If you use a custom domain hostname configured in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>,  additional steps are required to update your DNS server. For more information about using custom domain hostnames, see <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.NotForPDF"><MadCap:xref href="../configure-domain-name.htm">Configuring a Custom Domain Hostnames for  [%=Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title%]s</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlyForPDF"><a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.WebsitePDFLinks%]/Cloud/configure-domain-name.htm" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Configuring a Custom Domain Hostnames for  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/>s</a></MadCap:conditionalText>. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Uncontrolled Failover</dt>
      <dd>An uncontrolled failover occurs due to a sudden loss of connectivity to<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2022-12-12T23:38:31.3532604-05:00" MadCap:creator="GilYu" MadCap:initials="GI" MadCap:comment="instead of a replication active site - is this ok?" MadCap:editor="GilYu" MadCap:editDate="2022-12-12T23:38:50.0257363-05:00"> an Active site</MadCap:annotation>. When this occurs, only synchronous replication mode messages are guaranteed not to be lost. Messages remaining in the replication queue are not available at the disaster recovery site.</dd>
      <dt>Controlled Failover</dt>
      <dd>A controlled failover occurs when activity is transferred from one replication site to its replication mate in a planned manner for operational reasons. When you successfully follow the controlled failover procedure, no messages are  lost, regardless of the replication mode of the messages.</dd>
      <dt>Synchronous Message Replication</dt>
      <dd>A message or transaction is not considered persisted until it has been confirmed to be stored on both the active and standby sites. While providing a greater guarantee that the published message or transaction is not lost in an uncontrolled failover, synchronous replication incurs a performance penalty for the publisher, especially blocking publishers. This is because the publisher has to wait for communication between the two replication sites to complete before publishing the next message or transaction. In those use cases, the maximum message rate of a single publisher is limited by the round-trip time and available bandwidth between the active and the standby sites.</dd>
      <dt>Asynchronous Message Replication</dt>
      <dd>A message or transaction is considered persisted once it has been spooled and put into the replication queue (<code>#MSGVPN_REPLICATION_DATA_QUEUE</code>) on the Active site. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2022-12-12T23:40:24.8282919-05:00" MadCap:creator="GilYu" MadCap:initials="GI" MadCap:comment="We have mixed terms here. Should it be event broker service doesn't have to wait for communication with the event broker service at the Standby site? or should we say replication-active event broker service and replication-standby event broker service? " MadCap:editor="GilYu" MadCap:editDate="2022-12-12T23:42:00.8635819-05:00">This type of replication gives improved performance, since the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> does not have to wait for communication with the Standby site to complete. </MadCap:annotation>However, during an uncontrolled failure of the Active site, there is a chance that a message or transaction that the client has been told has completed was not actually delivered to the standby site. In this uncontrolled case, messages or transactions may be lost or duplicated.</dd>
