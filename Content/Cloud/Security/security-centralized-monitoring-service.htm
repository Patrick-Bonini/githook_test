    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Central Monitoring Service and Datadog Agents</h1>
    <p><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_long"/></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapOnlyOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_firstuse_initialcase"/></MadCap:conditionalText>  utilizes a central monitoring service to  collect monitoring data (statistics/metrics) and logs from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. The central monitoring service stores the information. Operational monitoring metrics, statistics, and logs are centrally monitored from the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.home_cloud_long"/>. Microservices that are part of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.home_cloud_short"/> communicate with the central monitoring service to retrieve reports and data regarding the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s.  The central monitoring service is  Datadog. Datadog  is a a third-party service that provides a secure solution built on a highly reliable stack for collecting and storing information that's SOC2, Type I and SOC2, Type II compliant. The SOC2 reports are available on the <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-soc-2-type-ii/" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Datadog website</a>.</p>
    <p>Datadog agents are configured by the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> to send monitoring data and logs about <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to the central monitoring service. Each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> has a Datadog agent configured, In the following diagram, the red box highlights the Datagog agents and the central monitoring service:</p>

      </div>
    </p>
    <p> Datadog agents collect only system-level information and metrics required to monitor and manage the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. The system-level information and metrics do not contain any personal-identifiable information – only  monitoring data about the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. The information exchanged between the Datadog agents and the central monitoring service  is encrypted using TLS 1.2.  For more information about the data collected, see <MadCap:xref href="security-audit.htm#summary-log-info">Summary of Log Information Collected.</MadCap:xref></p>
    <p>The data that is sent to the central monitoring service does identify the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> and its event brokers.  Since <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> is a SaaS offering, this required system-level information is vital to monitor the health of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s running in your deployment.</p>
    <p>The data collected by the central monitoring service is also accessible with an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> subscription. You can use <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_short"/> to monitor the performance of client applications, see statistics about your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, and receive notifications. Advanced visualizations are also available from a separate, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>-provided Datadog account. For more information about <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/>, see <MadCap:xref href="../Insights/Insights.htm">[%=Product-Names.insights_long%] Overview</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../Insights/Advanced-Monitoring/using-dashboards.htm">Using [%=Product-Names.insights_long%] Advanced Monitoring (Early Access)</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h2>Central Monitoring Service Connectivity</h2>
    <p> For Datadog to receive monitoring traffic it requires a number of public IP addresses to be allowed to send this monitoring traffic from your deployed <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. For <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>-controlled (<a href="../Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm#public-cloud" target="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/>s </a>and <a href="../Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm#solace-owned-vnet" target="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s</a>) deployments, this connectivity is configured by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>. For <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s, you (or a network administrator in your organization) must enable this connectivity. One way enable the traffic flow is to add and maintain the list of IP addresses in your network that send traffic to the central monitoring service. To get the list of IP addresses, see <MadCap:xref href="../proxy_agent.htm#getting-ip-addresses">Getting the IP Addresses for Monitoring Traffic</MadCap:xref>. </p>
