    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Authentication and Authorization<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"> to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase"/></MadCap:conditionalText></h1>
    <p>Users must be authenticated and authorized to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_firstuse"/>  to create <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, monitor <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, and design an event-driven architecture. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>'s account and user management system allows you to efficiently manage user accounts and assign permissions using roles that allow users to access the different categories of services in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> to manage your event-driven architecture (EDA). For more information, about user accounts and roles, see <MadCap:xref href="#user-roles-permissions">User-Centric and Role-Based Access</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput">Authentication and authorization of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> can also be integrated with your organization's existing identity management system if it supports OpenID Connection to enable Single Sign-On (SSO). For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#sso-authentication">[%=Product-Names.console_ui_long%] Authentication using SSO</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>In addition to users, client applications can be given access to  perform management tasks. Authentication and authorization is handled using API tokens created by users in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#api-keys">API Tokens for Client Applications</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Authentication and authorization to access to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s is also configurable.  You can also directly access <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/>. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="#access-broker-manager">Accessing to [%=Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Client application access is handled separately and is configured at the granularity of an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. For information about client authentication and authorization, see <MadCap:xref href="security-client-connectivity.htm">Client Application Connectivity and Security</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h2><a name="user-roles-permissions"/>User-Centric and Role-Based Access</h2>
    <p>There are built-in roles that are available on accounts. The permissions and roles for a user are assigned on a per account (workspace) basis. The granularity of the permissions authorizes a user to perform specific actions in the account. These fine-grained permissions permit for authenticated users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> orchestrate and manage event broker services</li>
      <li>manage event meshes</li>
      <li> design your event-driven architecture (EDA),</li>
      <li> monitor  your deployment of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_long"/> and access advanced monitoring capabilities</li>
      <li>modify billing for the account</li>
      <li>manage users, permissions, and account settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information about roles and permissions, see <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-user-management.htm#Roles">Roles and Permissions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the Administrator role must be provided to at least one user in an account, which permits that user to manage access within the account. Users can have different permissions on different accounts. This  allows the same user to have different access based on the account selected. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput">The authentication can be configured with SSO so that the user access is  handled on a per user account basis. This means that users don't need to remember different passwords for different accounts on <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/></MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
    <p>For example, a single user account can be used to authenticate, but in one account that user may be authorized  to create <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, but on another account, may not have that permission. For information about accounts, assigning roles, and setting permissions, see <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-user-management.htm#User">User Management</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h2 MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><a name="sso-authentication"/><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/> Authentication using SSO</h2>
    <p MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> recommends the integration of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> with an organization's existing central identity management system when it's based on OpenID Connect. This integration  provides single-sign on (SSO) for your organization's users and effectively presents <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> as another <i>service</i> that users are authorized to use. </p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput">SSO can  make user management and identity management more  secure,  easier to use, and gives your organization better control over user profiles. For example, changes to your organization's security strategy will seamlessly apply to  users who access <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. SSO integration is supported for various providers that includes Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, PingOne, and Auth0. For more information about integration to SSO, see <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-sso.htm">PubSub+ Cloud SSO with OpenID Connect</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput">For more information setting up SSO with OpenID Connect, see <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-sso.htm">PubSub+ Cloud SSO with OpenID Connect </MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h2><a name="access-broker-manager"/>Accessing  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/></h2>
    <p>You can access <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s directly using <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/>. For more information about <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/>, see <MadCap:xref href="security-broker-manager.htm">[%=Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short%] </MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>Access to the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> is handled through credentials that are generated when an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> is created. By default, a user with the Administrator or the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cluster_mgr"/> role in the account is pre-authenticated to  access <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_long"/> through the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>. Pre-authenticated access to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/> can be disabled for an entire account which forces users to enter the credentials manually. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="../manage-cloud-authentication.htm">Pre-Authentication for [%=Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <div class="Note">
      <p> Regardless of whether you enable or disable Pre-authentication Security, if your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are deployed in a  private network [customer-controlled Virtual Private Cloud/Virtual Network (VPC/VNet)], it is possible that you <u>can</u> connect from a public IP address to the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/> (outside of your private network) to create and configure <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s,  but <u>cannot</u> connect to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/>. </p>
      <p>The reason for this is because the ability to connect to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/> depends on the networking configuration of your private network (i.e.,  most private networks use 10.x.y.z, 172.x.y.z, or 192.x.y.z as IP addresses which are not accessible from a public network). If your network configuration permits it, you may connect to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsubmanager_short"/> when it's deployed in a private network if you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  use a VPN connection such as a VPN client on your computer (or AWS VPN) to connect to the VPC/VNet</li>
        <li>have VNet peering (Azure) or VPC peering (AWS) configured between the network from where you're connected, to the private network where the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are deployed</li>
        <li>have a DNS mapping from the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> to your private network. <a href="../../get-support.htm" class="link-internal" target="_blank">Contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></a> to configure this DNS mapping request</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2><a name="api-keys"/>API Tokens for Client Applications</h2>
    <p>Client applications can be authenticated and authorized to  perform management operations (e.g., create <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s or for continuous integration and development (CI/CD) functions) via  the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> APIs. This capability is useful in large-scale deployments that require automation to obtain efficiencies and better integrations with other enterprise systems.</p>
    <p> API key control for authentication and authorization to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> is provided with <i>API tokens</i>. These API tokens that can be generated on an per account basis to authenticate and authorize client applications  to perform management actions on an account. </p>
    <p>Users can generate API tokens in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>. The permissions that a user can assign to the generated API token is a <u>subset</u> of the permissions that they have in an account (Workspace). In other words, a user cannot create an API token with permissions over and beyond what they have been assigned. </p>
    <p>The user can also  revoke an API token at any time.  These API tokens permit for finer-grained control of permissions for client applications than the roles assigned to a user profile. For more information about the permissions and API tokens, see <MadCap:xref href="../ght_api_tokens.htm">Managing API Tokens</MadCap:xref>.</p>
