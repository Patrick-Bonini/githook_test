    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>VPC/VNet Isolation</h1>
    <p>You can deploy your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s in a Kubernetes cluster in an isolated Virtual Private Cloud or Virtual Network (VPC/VNet). An isolated VPC/VNet is recommended when you need additional security and want to keep your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s entirely separated from other enterprise applications/services and environments to limit risks and the vectors of attack. This may be an important consideration since the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> is given limited permissions to communicate with the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.home_cloud_long"/>.</p>
    <p> VPC/VNet isolation is also useful when you keep the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s completely separated from your client applications, which provides additional security. You may also want to use VPC/VNet isolation when you want your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s isolated in a regional VPC/VNet when you have <a href="cloud-security-encryption.htm#data-soverignty" class="link-internal">data sovereignty requirements</a>. </p>
    <p>In the following architecture diagram, the red box highlights a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>.</p>

    </p>
    <p>You can also deploy in the same way in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/> with a Kubernetes cluster. The reasons to use VPC/VNet isolation are the same - it's just a matter of whether the you or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> controls the infrastructure where the event broker services are located. The differences are summarized in <MadCap:xref href="security-details-summary.htm">Customer Roles and Responsibilities for Security</MadCap:xref>.  </p>
