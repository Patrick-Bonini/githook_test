    <p><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short_initialcase"/> provides product and data security in many ways:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Secure Cloud Architecture</dt>
      <dd><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short_initialcase"/> is designed to be performant, reliable, scalable, and most importantly, <u>secure</u>. When you use <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>, you can deploy your services to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/>s, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s, or <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s. 
                <ul><li>With <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/>s and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s, you can choose to deploy your customer-dedicated <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s (non-shared) in a shared region. Applications connect via the public Internet. </li><li> With <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are deployed in a region that's dedicated to a customer. This is best for environments that require isolated infrastructure and where applications connect from a private network rather than over the public Internet.</li><li>With a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>, you can deploy to a Kubernetes cluster in a region that you control. You tune and control all aspects of infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. </li></ul></dd>
      <dd>For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="security-architecture.htm">Security Architecture for [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase%]</MadCap:xref>. </dd>
      <dd>The deployment option chosen dictates the security aspects that are managed by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> or managed by the customer. In terms of security responsibilities, your responsibilities increase as you move from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/>s to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s. For an overview  of security responsibilities for the customer as compared to <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/>, see <MadCap:xref href="security-details-summary.htm">Customer Roles and Responsibilities for Security</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>VPC/VNet Isolation</dt>
      <dd>You can deploy your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s in a Kubernetes cluster within an isolated Virtual Private Cloud or Virtual Network (VPC/VNet). This isolated VPC/VNet gives  additional security when you:
            <ul><li>may not want the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to be accessible from the public Internet</li><li>need the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in an isolated environment (i.e., you don't want your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s in a multi-tenant environment - or shared public infrastructure)</li><li>have data sovereignty requirements (e.g., you require a kept in VPC/VNet in a particular region of the world)</li></ul></dd>
      <dd>  For more information about how <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are deployed in an isolated VPC/VNet, see <MadCap:xref href="vpc-isolation.htm">VPC/VNet Isolation</MadCap:xref>.
        </dd>
      <dt>Authentication and Authorization of Client Applications </dt>
      <dd>You have well-defined, granular control to how client applications authenticate and are authorized to access <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and perform management operations. There are two types of client applications:<ul><li>messaging applications that connect to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to exchange data and events (e.g., publish/subscribe) in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/></li><li>custom management applications that manage and monitor <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s. These applications are useful for automating the management of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s (configuration, monitoring, etc.) that are common for continuous integration and development (CI/CD) workflows.</li></ul></dd>
      <dd>  For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="security-client-connectivity.htm">Client Application Connectivity and Security</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Authentication and Authorization of  Users in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/></dt>
      <dd>Users must be authenticated and authorized  to create <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, monitor <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, and design an event-driven architecture. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> account and user management system allows you to efficiently manage user accounts and assign permissions that allows users to access the different categories of services in the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/>. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>  can be integrated with an OpenID Connected central identity management system to make it easier to manage users and provide Single Sign-On (SSO). There is support for Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, PingOne, and Auth0. </MadCap:conditionalText></dd>
      <dd>For more information about authentication and authorization of users in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>, see <MadCap:xref href="authentication_authorization_cloud.htm">Authentication and Authorization to [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_short%]</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Customer Data Protection</dt>
      <dd>Customer data is always protected in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> architecture logically splits the data into a <i>control plane</i> and a <i>messaging plane</i>. The control plane transports data related to management and monitoring, while the messaging plane transports the messaging data between the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s and customer applications.</dd>
      <dd>These distinct planes are highly secure and the  transport of data is encrypted both in transit and at rest (AES-256 and TLS 1.2) . The different types of data are important in the security architecture for these reasons: <ul><li>it clearly lets you have better control of the data – for instance, you can keep all the messaging data within an isolated VPC/VNet for customer-controlled environments</li><li>improved reliability and security –  impact to one plane doesn't affect the other</li></ul></dd>
      <dd>For more information about control  and messaging planes and data protection,  see <MadCap:xref href="cloud-security-encryption.htm">Data Protection in [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase%]</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Audit Logs and System Logs</dt>
      <dd><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short_initialcase"/> provides access to full logs and system notifications that includes:<ul><li>audit logs for the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_long"/> regarding security-related access</li><li>full logs regarding <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s (you can access these by setting up SysLog Forwarding)</li><li>a subset of logs from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are sent to our central monitoring service, which can be accessed from  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.insights_long"/> and contribute to additional notifications and alerts.</li></ul></dd>
      <dd>Note that logs and any information collected to monitor the health of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s or and system status do not contain personally identifiable information. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="security-audit.htm">Using Audit Logs and System Logs</MadCap:xref>.</dd>
      <dt>Compliance with Industry Standards</dt>
      <dd><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short_initialcase"/> is compliant with many important industry standards for cloud and SaaS, including:
				<ul><li> ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification</li><li>Cloud Security Alliance Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ) v3.1,</li><li> Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type 2 audit</li><li>Meets the requirements for executing a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) as required to meet Health Insurance Portability &amp; Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance  for engaging with subcontractors and service providers</li><li> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance for the protection of personal data and privacy of EU subjects</li></ul><p><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SAPTempHide">For more information, see <a href="https://solace.com/products/event-broker/cloud/security/" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">PubSub+ Cloud Security</a>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p></dd>
