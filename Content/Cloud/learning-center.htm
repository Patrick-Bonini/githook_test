    <h1>Using the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> Learning Center</h1>
    <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> Learning Center gives access to additional learning resources to help you become more familiar with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/>.</p>
    <p>The Acme Retail sample in the Learning Center includes sample environments, application domains, and model event meshes with runtime data that can simulate importing topics and consumer groups from a runtime Kafka broker.</p>
    <p>For more information, see the following sections:</p>

    <p>The Learning Center also provides access to How To videos for some <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> features.</p>

        <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/Cloud/Task_UI_Snippets/login_console.flsnp"/>
      </li>
      <li>Perform one of the following actions:<ul><li>If a banner at the top of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.console_ui_short"/> invites you to <b>Load the Sample</b> or <b>Continue the Sample</b>, click the button.</li><li>If you have already dismissed the banner, on the navigation bar, select <b>Learn &amp; Help </b><img src="../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/help_green_navbar.png" alt="" style="font-weight: bold;"/><b> &gt; Learning Center</b>.</li></ul></li>

    <h2><a name="Using_the_Sample"/>Using the Sample Data</h2>
    <p>The Learning Center steps you through locating and using the sample data in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/>. You must be an Administrator to load the sample data into <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/>. After the sample is loaded, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_user"/>s can access it.</p>
    <p>If you want to find the data yourself after the sample is loaded, the sample environments, application domains, and modeled event meshes all begin with <b>(Sample)</b>.</p>
    <p>To locate the sample data in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_catalog"/>, use filters to show only objects in the sample application domains. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="Event-Portal/event-portal-catalog-tool.htm#Searching">Searching for Objects</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h3>Importing Objects from Sample Audit Results</h3>
    <p>In <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_rt_event_manager"/>, you can try out importing sample data. For more information on importing audit results, see <MadCap:xref href="Event-Portal/event-portal-audit-runtime-data.htm">Auditing and Importing Runtime Data</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>The model event brokers in the sample were created to provide an example of how to use the audit and import features. They are not connected to actual <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_runtime_agent"/>s or runtime event brokers.</p>
    <p>When you import sample data from the Audit tab, you can import it into any application domain, not just the sample application domains.</p>
    <h2><a name="Deleting_the_Sample"/>Deleting the Sample Data</h2>
    <p>When users in your organization are done exploring the sample, you can delete all the sample  sample environments, application domains, and modeled event meshes from <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/>.</p>
    <p>Objects imported from the sample audit results into application domains other than the sample application domains are not deleted. The sample can't be deleted if a user has created a reference between a sample object and an object outside of the sample.</p>
    <p>To delete the sample, perform these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the <b>Learning Center</b> click <b>More Actions</b> <img src="../Resources/Images/Cloud/reusable-icons/more_actions_inverse.png" alt=""/> for the sample.</li>
      <li>Select <b>Delete Sample</b>.</li>
    </ol>
