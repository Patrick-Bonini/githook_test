    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/>Terminology for Replication</h1>
    <p>The following terms are used throughout the discussions of and instructions for replication of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Primary Site</dt>
      <dd>For a pair of replication mates, this is the main site and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> that is  has the replication-active status. This is  the Source service in a VM-based deployment during migration. At the start of a migration, this is the Active site; after migration, it becomes the Standby site (or formerly Active site). This site is no longer be used after migration and can be deleted after a successful migration.</dd>
      <dt>Backup Site</dt>
      <dd>For a pair of replication mates, this site acts as the Standby site and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> that is  has the replication-standby status. This is  the Target service in a VM-based deployment during migration. At the start of a migration, this is the Standby site; after migration, it becomes the Active site (or formerly Standby site). This site becomes the only site client applications use.</dd>
      <dt>Replication Pair</dt>
      <dd>Refers to two <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s that have the same Message VPN name, typically configured in separate regions, and configured with the replication feature. Each are replication mates of each other.</dd>
      <dt>Replication Mates</dt>
      <dd>Refers the other <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in a replication pair.</dd>
      <dt>Replication-Active</dt>
      <dd>Indicates the active event broker in the context of the Replication feature. This term is used to avoid confusion with active event broker service in a High-Availability Configuration where there is an active event broker and standby event broker.</dd>
      <dt>Replication-Standby</dt>
      <dd>Indicates the standby event broker in the context of the Replication feature. This term is used to avoid confusion with active event broker service in a High-Availability Configuration where there is an active event broker and standby event broker.</dd>
      <dt>Active Site</dt>
      <dd>The Message VPN for an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in  a replication pair that clients connect to for messaging traffic. It has a replication status of <code>active</code>. </dd>
      <dt>Standby Site</dt>
      <dd>The Message VPN for an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> in a replication pair that is not active and replicates the messages. It has the replication status of <code>standby</code>.</dd>
      <dt>Failover</dt>
      <dd>The act of switching activity from one <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> to its replication mate. The failover is complete when the custom hostname is assigned to newly Active site.</dd>
      <dt>Host List</dt>
      <dd>For client applications, a host list specifies the list of hosts to try. When replication is configured for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s, the host list should never use the generated names nor the IP addresses of the event broker services. Only the custom host name for the replication pair must be used.</dd>
      <dt>Custom Hostname</dt>
      <dd>In <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>, you must configure a custom hostname for client applications to use to connect to the replication-Active <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. The custom hostname is an alternate hostname to access the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. When you use the replication feature, you cannot use the system-generated names for failover and you must not use the initial, generated hostnames for client connections. </dd>
      <dd>
        <p class="Note ">If you use a custom domain hostname configured in a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>, additional steps are required to update your DNS server. For more information about using custom domain hostnames, see <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.NotForPDF"><MadCap:xref href="../configure-domain-name.htm">Configuring a Custom Domain Hostnames for [%=Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title%]s</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.OnlyForPDF"><a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.WebsitePDFLinks%]/Cloud/configure-domain-name.htm" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Configuring a Custom Domain Hostnames for  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/>s</a></MadCap:conditionalText>. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Controlled Failover</dt>
      <dd>A controlled failover occurs when activity is transferred from one replication site to its replication mate in a planned manner for operational reasons. When you successfully follow the controlled failover procedure, no messages are  lost, regardless of the replication mode of the messages. A controlled failover is the procedure to use to migrate connectivity from your VM-based  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> (Source service) to the Kubernetes-based  <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> (Target service).</dd>
      <dt>Synchronous Message Replication</dt>
      <dd>A message or transaction is not considered persisted until it has been confirmed to be stored on both the active and standby sites. Synchronous replication incurs a performance penalty for the publisher, especially blocking publishers. This is because the publisher has to wait for communication between the two replication sites to complete before publishing the next message or transaction. In those use cases, the maximum message rate of a single publisher is limited by the round-trip time and available bandwidth between the active and the standby sites.</dd>
      <dt>Asynchronous Message Replication</dt>
      <dd>A message or transaction is considered persisted once it has been spooled and put into the replication queue (<code>#MSGVPN_REPLICATION_DATA_QUEUE</code>) on the Active site. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2022-12-12T23:40:24.8282919-05:00" MadCap:creator="GilYu" MadCap:initials="GI" MadCap:comment="We have mixed terms here. Should it be event broker service doesn't have to wait for communication with the event broker service at the Standby site? or should we say replication-active event broker service and replication-standby event broker service? " MadCap:editor="GilYu" MadCap:editDate="2022-12-12T23:42:00.8635819-05:00">This type of replication gives improved performance, since the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> does not have to wait for communication with the Standby site to complete. </MadCap:annotation></dd>
