    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Cloud"/><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> Usage</h1>
    <p>Subscriptions for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> are based on the number of objects that exist in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/>. If you reach the object limit, you must increase your subscription or delete objects before you can create or import more objects.</p>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> 2.0 allows you to design an event-driven architecture by adding objects to modeled event meshes in <MadCap:xref href="environments.htm">Environments</MadCap:xref>. Because environments reduce the need to have multiple <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_long"/> accounts for different stages of the development process, adding objects to environments counts against your account limit.</p>
    <p>The total number of objects in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventportal_product_short"/> is counted according to the following parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only applications, events, and schemas counted towards the object limit. Enumerations, Event APIs, and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.eventapiproduct_long"/>s do not count.</li>
      <li>New versions of an object don't count towards the object limit. An event with five versions counts as one object.</li>
      <li>Objects are counted again when they are added to a new environment.</li>
      <li>Objects are counted once per environment, regardless of the number of versions added or the number of modeled event meshes they are added to.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Assume that you have these objects in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have four applications: Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.</li>
      <li>Jupiter publishes four events: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</li>
      <li>Mars publishes two events: Phobos and Deimos.</li>
      <li>Venus doesnâ€™t publish any events but subscribes to the events published by Mars and Jupiter.</li>
      <li>Mercury doesn't reference any events.</li>
      <li>Two events, Rhea and Titan, are in Draft state and are not yet referenced by any applications.</li>
      <li>Rhea and Titan reference a schema called Rings. All other events use a primitive type schema.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.ep_designer"/> you have four applications, eight events, and one schema for a total 13 objects that count against the object limit.</p>
    <p>You have an environment called Production with a modeled event mesh called Solar System.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The modeled event mesh includes the applications Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.</li>
      <li>Jupiter publishes four events.</li>
      <li>Mars publishes two events.</li>
      <li>Venus subscribes to the six events published by the other applications, but the events are only counted once.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, in the Production environment you have three applications and six events for an additional 9 objects that count towards the limit.</p>
    <p>You have a second environment called Development with two modeled event meshes: Solar System and Inner Planets:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Solar System modeled event mesh contains newer versions of the same applications and events in the Production environment. They are all counted again because they are in another environment.</li>
      <li>The Inner Planets modeled event mesh includes the applications Mars, Venus, and Mercury and the events Phobos and Demos. Only Mercury adds to the object count because the other objects were already counted in the Solar System modeled event mesh.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, in the Development Environment you count nine objects from the Solar System modeled event mesh and one from the Inner Planets modeled event mesh for a total of 10 more objects.</p>
    <p>Your object count against the limit is 13 objects from Designer plus 9 objects from the Production environment and 10 objects from the Development environment for a total of 32 objects counted against your limit.</p>
