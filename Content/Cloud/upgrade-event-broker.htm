    <h2><a name="why-upgrade-cloud"/>Why Do I Need to Upgrade?</h2>
    <p>You should upgrade your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s for these reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The full support phase has ended—Full support for your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s is no longer available. In this situation, you must upgrade to the most recent Production release that supports upgrade. </li>
      <li>New features or capabilities—You want to access new features or capabilities, or you simply want to remain current. In this situation,
                you must upgrade to the most recent production release that supports upgrade. </li>
      <li>Security fixes are required—You require a fix (security or another critical update) in the current version that you're using. For versions in the full support phase, you can upgrade to a maintenance load.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="when-upgrade-cloud"/>When Can I Upgrade?</h2>
    <p><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> sends you product notification emails that announce 
            releases and maintenance loads in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> when they are available.</MadCap:conditionalText> You can view the planned release dates  at  <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapOnlyOutput"><MadCap:xref href="cloud-event-broker-releases.htm">Software Event Broker Versions and Support in [%=Product-Names.cloud_product_titlecase%]</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><a href="https://solace.com/support/support-dates-for-release-versions/" class="link-offsite">Supported Dates for Release Versions</a></MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
    <p>You can upgrade only to Production releases that support upgrade. You can schedule an upgrade immediately after a Production release is released in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>.</p>
    <p>You can also upgrade existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to maintenance loads. These loads are where critical and high-level vulnerabilities are addressed in a maintenance load within 30 days of availability of an industry-accepted remedy. These  maintenance loads are available only for releases in the <a href="understand-event-broker-releases.htm#support-phases" class="link-internal">full support phase</a>. When possible, we recommend that you upgrade your existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to the most recent release that supports upgrades. This recommendation is because the most recent release has additional fixes and minor security fixes in addition to critical security updates.</p>
    <h2><a name="how-upgrade-cloud"/>How Do I Upgrade?</h2>
    <p>You can book an upgrade slot directly using <a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.CloudCalendlyUpgrades%]" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Calendly</a>. At any time, you can schedule an upgrade for any existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to the latest major release that supports upgrade and is in the full support phase. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Efforts are made to minimize delay, but early scheduling is best to secure the time that you want. The owners of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s receive notifications when an upgrade is scheduled, when the upgrade starts, and when the upgrade  completes. </li>
      <li>For <a href="Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/></a> and <a href="Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>s</a> deployments, you do not need to be present on any calls while the upgrade occurs as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> does the upgrade for you. </li>
      <li>
        <p>For deployments on <a href="Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s</a>,  a person from your organization must be available on a call to access to your deployment during the short upgrade period for an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>. </p>
        <p class="Note">In <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s, the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> is usually upgraded automatically as part of <a href="#how-are-brokers-upgraded" class="link-internal"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> upgrades</a>. If your deployment includes a private repository as part of your deployment, we recommend that you implement automation to pull the most recent images for the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> to ensure it is kept current. <a href="../get-support.htm" class="link-internal"> Contact <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/></a> for more information.</p>

    <h2><a name="impact-upgrade-cloud"/>What Is the Impact to My <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/>s When I  Upgrade?</h2>
    <p>Typically, upgrading an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> takes only 15-30 minutes, depending on factors such as the deployment type and region. Multiple <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s can be upgraded at the same time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>High-Availability—Upgrades to High-Availability (HA) <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are in-service upgrades and do not impact client applications. A brief interruption of less than one minute occurs  during the HA activity failover.</li>
      <li><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.class_100"/><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput">and Standalone</MadCap:conditionalText> services—Upgrades are service affecting.

    <h3><a name="More"/>More FAQs About Upgrading <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/>s</h3>
    <p>The following are frequently asked questions about upgrades to <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Can more than one <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> be upgraded at the same time?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yes. For a standard two-hour upgrade slot, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> can upgrade five to six <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s..</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>What happens if the upgrade fails?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>We troubleshoot any errors  during the upgrade slot. Errors are resolved during the remaining time in the upgrade slot when possible. If the errors cannot be resolved, we open an investigation to identify the cause and provide resolution, and the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> is reverted to the same version before the upgrade started using our rollback procedure.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>What type of validation is performed to ensure the upgrade was successful?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>A standard post-upgrade checklist is followed for each upgrade to verify the broker metrics through our monitoring system. Validity checks determine that the broker is running with the correct version. <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> recommends that you validate your client connections following the upgrade.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Will connected applications go offline during the upgrade?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>During the failover period  for <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s with high-availability, there may be a temporary loss of connectivity for client applications as client applications reconnect. You do not need to disconnect them prior to the upgrade. For failover period impacts, see <MadCap:xref href="#impact-upgrade-cloud">What Is the Impact of Upgrading?</MadCap:xref></p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Can we upgrade our environments separately?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yes! Many of our customers take a phased approach to upgrade their <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s starting with the least critical environments. For example, many customers first start an upgrade with a development, staging, and then production environments. If you require this phased approach,  you must book one upgrade slot per environment.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Can I initiate the upgrades myself?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. At any time,  schedule an upgrade via <a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.CloudCalendlyUpgrades%]" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Calendly</a> for any existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to a more recent, major release that supports upgrade and is in the full support phase.</dd>

        <b>?</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yes. For Preview releases, you can upgrade them only to their corresponding  Production release (the same first two digits of the release version). For example, if you have a 10.5.0 version of an event broker service, you can upgrade to 10.5.1.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Does <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> retain any configuration backups or data before performing the upgrade?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>No, we do not take any configuration backups before upgrades because configuration data is replicated and available for rollback when High-Availability (HA) or optional Disaster Recovery (DR) is available. In general, there are no configuration changes performed during upgrades. You (the customer) are responsible for configuration management and backups.

      </dd>
      <dt>What communication method is used for upgrades?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Depending on the stage of the upgrade cycle, you can expect the following communication:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When your services have passed full support, you will receive an email from <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> (email is from <MadCap:variable name="Manifest-Products-Links.ProductNotificationEmail"/>) requesting that you schedule an upgrade.</li>
          <li>After you have scheduled your upgrade slot in <a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.CloudCalendlyUpgrades%]" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Calendly</a>, we create an RT service ticket in your queue to communicate any updates related to the upgrade.</li>

    <h2><a name="how-are-brokers-upgraded"/>How are High Availability <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/>s Upgraded?</h2>
    <p>Upgrades of high-availability <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s use the following three general procedures: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pre-upgrade checks—Gathers information and prepares your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> for the upgrade. </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <dt>Pre-upgrade checks</dt>
    <dd>Prior to upgrading your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> performs a series of pre-checks. These pre-checks ensure we have all the information that is required to make sure your upgrade goes smoothly in the least amount of time. The following are checks that we perform or information we require:
        <ul><li>Review of your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> to determine if it requires any new configuration changes due to the introduction of new <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> features. You may be required to upgrade the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s.</li><li>Identification of any special configuration that need to be considered during the upgrade. Special configurations include (but are not limited to) items such as, custom TLS certificates, the need to retain your MQTT cache, or manually provisioned Load Balancers. </li><li>The <a href="Deployment-Considerations/deployment-options-ownership.htm" class="link-internal">deployment type</a> (<MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>, <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.public_region"/>, or <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.dedicated_region"/>) and whether we have access to your datacenter/region.</li><li>Whether your deployment uses any Controlled Availability (CA) features. If it does, you may need to increase the available memory footprint before the upgrade in <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s.</li><li>Whether any of the tags or metadata that are used by your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s require updates.</li><li>Confirmation that  the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> images are available.</li></ul><p>If the pre-upgrade checks fail and the upgrade cannot be performed, you will be contacted by <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> with information as to why the pre-check failed, actions you can take to address the failures, and to reschedule the upgrade.</p></dd>
    <dt>High Availability <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title"/> Upgrade</dt>
    <dd>Prior to the upgrade, the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> runs a series of automated checks. These checks include: 
        <ul><li>Redundancy </li><li>Config-Sync </li><li>DMR</li><li>Image Accessibility </li><li>MQTT Retain Memory </li></ul></dd>
    <dd>After the upgrade completes, the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> begins upgrading the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>  over a series of steps. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> pauses between each step to check that each <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> node maintains redundancy during the process. The upgrade process begins with the primary and monitoring event brokers active, and the backup event broker  in standby. From there, the individual event brokers are upgraded in the following steps:
        <ol><li>The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> upgrades the monitoring event broker.</li><li>The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> upgrades the standby event broker. </li><li>The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> ceases activity in the active event broker  and transfers activity to the now upgraded standby event broker. The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> waits during this process to ensure the activity transfer is complete before proceeding. </li><li>Once the activity transfer is complete, the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_agent_short"/> upgrades the primary event broker. Once upgraded, the formerly active event broker  now becomes the standby event broker.</li></ol></dd>
    <dt>Post upgrade checks</dt>
    <dd>Once the upgrade is complete, <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> performs several post-upgrade checks to ensure your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> is up and running. These checks include:
        <ul><li>Ensuring that the monitoring pod is up and running, that its version is correct, and that it has a connection.</li><li>Validating that our operational monitoring capabilities, including ensuring the upgraded service is reported as such, and that we are receiving metrics. </li></ul></dd>
    <h2><a name="rec-upgrade-cloud"/>How Often Do I Need to Upgrade and What are Common Recommendations?</h2>
    <p>For the best upgrade experience, follow the recommendations below.</p>
    <h5>Upgrade <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s to a major release at least once a year</h5>
    <p>It is mandatory that you upgrade your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s at least once per year to a major version. This is because full support ends one year after the              <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/> is first released. Upgrading also ensures that your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are kept up-to-date with the latest security fixes.</p>
    <p>After the full support phase ends and your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s transition to
                the technical support phase, schedule an upgrade slot with us using <a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.CloudCalendlyUpgrades%]" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Calendly</a>. </p>
    <p>Note that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> upgrades any
                        <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s that are out of the 
<a href="understand-event-broker-releases.htm#technical-support-phase" class="link-internal">technical support phase</a> to maintain the security and integrity of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>. We will attempt to                contact you prior to performing the upgrade.</p>
    <h5>Upgrade regularly to get security and critical fixes</h5>
    <p>You can upgrade existing <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> versions to maintenance loads. These loads are where critical and high-level vulnerabilities are addressed.  High-severity and security fixes are available within 30 days of availability of an industry-accepted remedy.  Critical fixes are available within 30 days of the 
            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="SAP.SapHideFromOutput"><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/> release that contains the fix. These upgrades apply only to releases in  the <a href="understand-event-broker-releases.htm#full-support-phase" class="link-internal">full support phase</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For versions in the full support phase, you can upgrade within the release version to a maintenance load.<p> For example, if version 10.1 were in full support, you could upgrade to 10.1.2.0 to get a fix—even if the next major release that supports upgrade was available. Conversely, if 10.1 was not in full support, you would have to upgrade to next major release (that supports upgrade) to pick up the fixes.</p></li>
      <li>New <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s are always created with the most recent maintenance load of the version selected.<p>For example, suppose you initially created an <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/> using version 10.6, which at the time was based on <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/> version 10.6.1.12. If a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/> maintenance load with a version of 10.6.1.99 were released, all subsequent <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s that you create with version 10.1 would use the 10.6.1.99 maintenance load of the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/>.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Proactively schedule upgrades for your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s </h5>
    <p>As a customer of <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/>, you are
            responsible for scheduling an upgrade using <a href="[%=Manifest-Products-Links.CloudCalendlyUpgrades%]" target="_blank" alt="Calendly link to upgrade [%=Product-Names.broker_cloud_short%]s" class="link-offsite">Calendly</a>. 
                Upgrades can be scheduled with at least seven calendar days' notice to allow our team adequate time to prepare for your upgrade. We make the best  effort to minimize the delay for critical maintenance loads. </p>
    <p>For more information about roles and responsibilities for upgrading, see <MadCap:xref href="Deployment-Considerations/deployment-roles-responsibilities.htm#Upgrades">Upgrades to [%=Product-Names.cloud_agent_short%] and [%=Product-Names.broker_cloud_short_title%]s</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h3><a name="what-if-I-do-not-upgrade"/>What Happens If I Don’t Upgrade In Time?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned previously on this page, when the full support phase ends and the technical support phase starts, you <b>must</b> upgrade. If you do not upgrade within the six-month technical support period, we automatically proceed with upgrading your <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_cloud_short"/>s  to minimize your security risk exposure and to ensure that <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.cloud_product_short"/> remains  modernized against any security and vulnerability threats.</p>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> will notify you of the time and date of the upgrade slot. For <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.customer-controlled_region"/>s, we request that you (or a representative with access to the your private region) be  present during the upgrade slot. If you are not available during the upgrade slot, there's a risk that any issues that arise can't be resolved as <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> does not have access to certain parts of your private region (private network or virtual private cloud).</p>
