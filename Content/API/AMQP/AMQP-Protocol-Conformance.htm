    <h1>AMQP 1.0 Protocol Conformance</h1>
    <p>This page is a statement of functionally-visible restrictions, limitations and non-conformances between OASIS AMQP Version 1.0 and Solaceʼs AMQP implementation. Each section noted on this page indicates an area of deviation between some aspect of the AMQP protocol and Solace's implementation. It should be noted that Solace PubSub+ event brokers support only the server-side role.</p>
    <p>The section numbers in each heading refer to the corresponding section in this OASIS AMQP protocol specification:</p>

    <p>“This basic pattern can be modified in a variety of ways to achieve different guarantees. For example if the sending application settles the delivery before sending it, this results in an at-most-once guarantee. The sender has indicated up front with his initial transmission that he has forgotten everything about this delivery and will therefore make no further attempts to send it. If this delivery makes it to the receiver, the receiver clearly has no obligation to respond with updates of the receiver’s delivery state, as they would be meaningless and ignored by the sender.”</p>

    <p>“Similarly, if the basic scenario is modified such that the receiving application chooses to settle immediately upon processing the message rather than waiting for the sender to settle first, that yields an at-least-once guarantee. If the disposition frame indicated below is lost, then upon link recovery the sender will not see the delivery-tag in the receiver’s unsettled map and will therefore assume the delivery was lost and resend it, resulting in duplicate processing of the message at the receiver.”</p>

    <p>“As one might guess, the scenario presented initially where the sending application settles when the receiver reaches a terminal state, and the receiving application settles when the sender settles, results in an exactly-once guarantee.

Upon completion of this reduction of state, the two parties MUST suspend and re-attempt to resume the link.

    </p>
    <p>An event broker applies <i>ingress admission control</i> to received messages from clients of all protocols, including AMQP. <i>Ingress admission control</i> ensures that, if multiple clients are concurrently sending large messages to an event broker, that the event broker’s ingress buffering is not exhausted by a set of clients with partially-sent large messages. If the event broker were to all such ingress buffer exhaustion to occur, no client could make forward progress in completing its message transfer.</p>
    <p>AMQP allows a sender to interleave multiple partially-transferred messages on different AMQP links within a single AMQP connection. No other protocol currently supported by the event broker allows this.</p>
    <p>AMQP’s potential interleaving of multiple partially-transferred messages requires a change to the event broker’s <i>ingress admission control</i>. Specifically, if the sum of the sizes of all partially-transferred messages within a single AMQP connection exceeds about 64 MiB, the event broker will <code>close</code> the AMQP connection with an error of <code>resource-limit-exceeded</code>.</p>
    <p>An event broker will not interleave multiple partially-transferred messages on AMQP links for which it is the sender.</p>

    <p>The <code>address-string</code> used to identify a terminus within an event broker will be a queue name or a topic.</p>
    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.HideFromAllOutput">There is no further ornamentation (i.e. no prefix of “/QUEUE/” or “/TOPIC/”, no embedded JMS destination type) within the <code>address-string</code> itself. Durable queues have their queue name, without any “#P2P/QUE/” prefix, in the <code>address-string</code>. However, temporary queues and temporary topic endpoints do have prefixes of “#P2P/QTMP/” and “#P2P/TTMP/”, respectively, at the start of their <code>address-string</code>.</p>
    <p>JMS address types (durable queue, durable topic, temporary queue, temporary topic) are disambiguated using the <i>x-opt-jms-dest</i> and <i>x-opt-jms-reply-to</i> <code>message-annotations</code>.</p>
