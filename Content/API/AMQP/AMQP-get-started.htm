    <h1>AMQP </h1>
    <p><MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> event brokers support AMQP as a component. Here you'll find links to several tutorials to get you started developing AMQP applications. The tutorials cover common messaging functions such as Publish/Subscribe and Request/Reply.</p>
    <h4>Using AMQP</h4>
    <p>If you're not quite ready to start messaging, and you'd like to learn a bit more about using AMQP with <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/>, and why AMQP might be a good messaging choice for your use-cases, take a look at <MadCap:xref href="Using-AMQP.htm">Using AMQP</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h4>AMQP Concepts</h4>
    <p>If you haven't used AMQP and <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> together before, you may want to look at the <MadCap:xref href="../Component-Maps.htm#AMQP">AMQP</MadCap:xref> section of the <MadCap:xref href="../Component-Maps.htm">Overview: How Apps Interact with PubSub+ Messaging Components</MadCap:xref> page. It'll take you on a tour of the PubSub+ event broker's messaging components, and provides a high-level overview of how  data moves from producers to the event broker, and from the event broker to consumers, with AMQP.</p>
