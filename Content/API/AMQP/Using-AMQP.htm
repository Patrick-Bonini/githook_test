    <h1>Using AMQP 1.0</h1>
    <p>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) 1.0 is  a wire-line protocol that defines messages and procedures for sending and receiving messages over a network. Using an OASIS standardized protocol for messaging allows any client speaking AMQP on the wire to communicate with other AMQP speaking clients or brokers on the network regardless of the languages the clients are using. </p>
    <p>AMQP 1.0 is a richly featured and extensible protocol that provides support for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most message exchange patterns including publish-subscribe, request-reply and message queue.</li>
      <li>All classes of service.</li>
      <li>Detailed header fields such as TTL, replyTo and user properties.</li>
      <li>Portable encoding of messages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you'd like to learn more about AMQP 1.0, consider taking a look at <a href="https://www.amqp.org/">amqp.org</a>.</p>
    <p>As of Solace PubSub+ software event broker version 8.4.0, and appliance load 8.3.0 for the Solace PuSub+ 3530/3560, event brokers can act as AMQP 1.0 brokers, so any AMQP 1.0 compliant client can interact with an event broker as it would with other AMQP 1.0 brokers.</p>
    <p>If you're already familiar with AMQP 1.0 and just want to start messaging, you'll want to go over to <MadCap:xref href="AMQP-get-started.htm#AMQP-Tutorials">Get Started with AMQP Messaging Tutorials</MadCap:xref>. There you'll find a number of tutorials that will help you get going in no time.</p>
    <p>The sections below are recommended for programmers and network architects who require background information regarding potential use-cases, and information about specific features, limitations and choices associated with using the Solace implementation. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../Services/Managing-AMQP-Messaging.htm">Managing AMQP Messaging</MadCap:xref> for information about managing the AMQP service on the event broker.</p>
