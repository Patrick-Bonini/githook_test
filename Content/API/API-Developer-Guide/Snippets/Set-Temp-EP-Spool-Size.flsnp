    <h4>Recommendation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Exercise caution if a client application frequently creates temporary endpoints to ensure that the sum of all temporary endpoint spool sizes does not exceed the total spool size provisioned for the Message VPN.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By default, the message spool quota of a Message VPN and endpoint  is based on an over-subscription model.  For instance, it's possible to set the message spool quota  of multiple endpoints to the same quota as that of an entire Message VPN. Temporary endpoints created by a client application default to 4000 MB for the Solace application and 1500 MB for the software event broker. When temporary endpoints are used extensively by a client application, the message spool over-subscription model can quickly get out-of-control when temporary endpoints are being created on-demand. Therefore, it's recommended that a client application overwrite an endpointâ€™s default message spool size to a value that is inline with expected usage, especially if temporary endpoints are heavily used.</p>
