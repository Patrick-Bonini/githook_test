    <h1>Run Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Before running your compiled application, consider the following guidelines for the messaging API that you are using.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="javaRTO-api"/>Java RTO API</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For applications running on UNIX or Linux systems, set the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable to specify the run-time path needed to find the appropriate RTO API library files.</li>
      <li>For applications running on Windows systems, the <code>lib</code> directory in the API distribution archive includes a dynamic link library. When running clients built with these libraries, make sure to copy the dynamic-link library (DLL) to the directory that contains your client or copy it to a location where the DLL can be found by the operating system.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="c-api"/>C API</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For an application running on a UNIX or Linux system, set the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable that specifies the run-time path needed to find the appropriate SolClient library files.</li>
      <li>For an application running on Windows systems, the <code>lib</code> directory in the API distribution archive includes a dynamic link library. When running clients built with these libraries, make sure to copy the DLL to the directory that contains your client or copy it to a location where the DLL can be found by the operating system.</li>
      <li>For an iOS application, always statically link against <code>libsolclient</code>. <code>libsolclient</code> includes <code>libssl.a</code> and <code>libcrypto.a</code>, so an iOS application does not need any extra steps to create secure connections.<br/>For specific instructions on running the <code>SecureSession</code> sample for iOS, see the <code>README</code> file in the <code>ex/certs</code> directory in the location where the iOS API is installed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="net-api"/>.NET API</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that the corresponding .NET API assembly can be located and loaded by the .NET runtime.</li>
      <p class="Note">The .NET API requires Microsoft .NET 2.0 or above framework.</p>
    </ul>
