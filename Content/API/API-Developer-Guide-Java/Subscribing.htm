    <h1>Receiving Messages</h1>
    <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> Messaging APIÂ for Java  allows clients to  consume messages published to any topics they are subscribed to.</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>Receivers can consume messages from the event broker in the following ways:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <MadCap:xref href="Java-DM-Subscribe.htm">Consume as Direct Messages </MadCap:xref>
      </dt>
      <dd>Direct messaging provides a reliable, but not guaranteed delivery of messages from the publishing clients to receiving clients. Direct messages are sent  <i>exactly once</i>. Direct messages can be delivered to a client in a session when the event broker has matching topic subscriptions for that client. Direct messages differ from persistent messages as they:</dd>
      <ul>
        <li>are sent at most once</li>
        <li> are not retained for a client when that client is not connected to an event broker</li>
        <li> can be discarded when congestion or system failures are encountered</li>
        <li>are not acknowledged upon delivery</li>
      </ul>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <a href="Java-PM-Subscribe.htm" class="link-internal">Consume as Persistent Messages</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>Persistent messaging (also referred to as guaranteed messages) can be used to ensure the delivery of a message between two applications. Persistent messages are <i>delivered at least once</i> and are useful in scenarios where  the receiving application may disconnect, but cannot tolerate message loss.  </dd>
      <dd>To receive persistent messages, a client must create a consumer flow to bind to a durable or non-durable queue  on the event broker where the published messages are stored on a message spool. After the client application is bound to the queue, and it has an active consumer flow (that is, a flow through which messages are being delivered), it can consume persistent messages from the queue.</dd>
