    <h1>Message Types</h1>
    <p>The Solace JMS implementation supports the following message types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Persistent</u><![CDATA[
                ]]><p>Persistent messages are received by a consumer once-and-only-once and in the same order that they were originally published. In addition, Persistent messages sent to durable endpoints must not be lost. </p><p>In the Solace JMS implementation, Persistent messages are transported using the Guaranteed Transport mode.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Non-Persistent</u><![CDATA[ 
                ]]><p>Non-Persistent messages are received by a consumer at-most-once. That is, under normal operations, messages should be delivered once to the consumer, but they can never be delivered more than once to the same consumer.</p><p>In the Solace JMS implementation, Non-Persistent messages can be transported using Guaranteed or Direct Transport modes.</p></li>
    </ul>
