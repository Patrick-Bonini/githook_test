    <h1>OSGI Support</h1>
    <p>The <code>sol-jms</code> jar library file includes metadata conforming to the OSGi standards and can be deployed as an OSGi bundle.</p>
    <p>The <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> JCSMP has also implemented a semantic versioning system that uses a numbering pattern of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. With this system, increments to each of these numbers has specific meaning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <u>MAJOR</u>
      </li>
      <p>Incompatible API changes were made</p>
      <li>
        <u>MINOR</u>
      </li>
      <p>Backwards-compatible functionality was added</p>
      <li>
        <u>PATCH</u>
      </li>
      <p>Backwards-compatible bug fixes were made</p>
    </ul>
    <p>The last release prior to the implementation of the semantic version numbering was Version 7.2.2.</p>
