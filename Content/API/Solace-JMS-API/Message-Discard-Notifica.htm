    <h1>Message Discard Notification</h1>
    <p>A client application receiving messages through non-durable consumers that use Direct Transport can test whether the event broker has discarded any non‑persistent messages previous to the current received message.</p>
    <p>To test a non-persistent message sent using Direct Transport for its discard indication status, call <code>message.getBooleanProperty(SupportedProperty.SOLACE_JMS_PROP_MSG_DISCARD_INDICATION</code>). If the call returns <code>true</code>, the event broker has discarded one or more messages prior to the current message; if the call returns <code>false</code>, no messages prior to the current message were lost.</p>
    <p>When a client application detects a message discard has occurred, it should handle this event appropriately. For example, it can follow its regular Session re‑initialization procedure.</p>
    <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note:  &lt;/b&gt;">Message discards can occur if an event broker’s egress per-client priority queues fill up with received messages. When this occurs, the oldest messages on the queues can be discarded to allow new incoming messages to be enqueued. Egress per-client priority queues could fill up in a situation where “slow subscribers” are not consuming messages quickly enough. For more information on egress per-client priority queues and how to configure them, refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:managing_msg_delivery_resources_4245516314_92633" href="../../Messaging/Managing-Event-Delivery-Resources.htm">Managing Message Delivery Resources</MadCap:xref>.</p>
