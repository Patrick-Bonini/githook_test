    <p>This section provides details for experienced developers to quickly start using the Solace JMS API.</p>
    <p>The Solace System JMS implementation supports JMS 1.1, which is backward compatible with JMS 1.0.2b. It also supports Java applications in standalone mode only.</p>
    <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: Â &lt;/b&gt;"> For JMS clients to successfully send and receive messages, they must be able to connect to an event broker that is up and running and has a basic configuration to support them.</p>
