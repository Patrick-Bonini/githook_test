    <h1>Delayed Redelivery</h1>
    <p>This feature allows for the delayed redelivery of messages to clients who are consuming guaranteed messages using local transactions. Delayed redelivery is controlled by a timer and is triggered by a transaction rollback. While the redelivery timer is running, the consumer flow is blocked if it participated in a rolled back transaction, and message delivery to the application is suspended until the timer expires. A multiplier is used to allow for exponential back-off of redelivery attempts. </p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p>Delayed redelivery  is a Controlled Availability (CA) feature. Please <a href="../../get-support.htm" class="link-internal">contact Solace</a> to find out if this feature is supported for your use case.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The entire delayed redelivery configuration is performed on a PubSub+ event broker and transferred to the consumer flow upon a bind request to a queue or topic endpoint. Configuration information updates are not pushed to the client automatically, but received in the API with a broker response when the flow is connected or reconnected. Configuration on a PubSub+ event broker side can be updated only when no client is connected to the queue and connectivity to the queue is disabled.  In other words, you cannot change, override, or review the configuration  using the API.</p>
