</h1>
    <p>The Solace JMS implementation allows Java applications to access an event broker using the standard JMS Application Programming Interface (API). JMS provides a common way for Java applications to create, send, receive, and read an enterprise messaging system's messages. For detailed information on JMS, refer to the JMS specification available at the Oracle Web site.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The Solace JMS implementation is comprised of the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>JMS API</u><![CDATA[
        ]]><p>The Solace JMS API uses the standard JMS interface to provide JMS service for Java-based applications through Solace PubSub+.</p></li>
      <li><u>Solace PubSub+ event broker </u><![CDATA[       ]]><p>An event broker acts as the JMS broker for the JMS client. As such, it provides access control, message routing, selecting, and filtering.</p><p>An event broker can also provide Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) service, which allows JMS clients to perform JNDI lookups and object binding.</p><p>Solace PubSub+ can support multiple event brokers, each operating in its own JMS domain.</p></li>
      <li><u>SolAdmin</u><![CDATA[
			]]><p>The SolAdmin application is an administration tool that allows administrators to bind event broker objects (such as connection factories, topics, and queues) to JMS objects, which are then stored in the JNDI store. Administrators can use SolAdmin or the Command Line Interface (CLI) to configure and monitor the JMS objects.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: Â &lt;/b&gt;">The Solace JMS implementation can optionally be used to provide messaging service in Java Platform Enterprise Edition (Java EE) application server environments.
