    <p>This section describes how to publish messages using the JMS API. It also discusses creating Destination objects that messages can be published to and consumed from.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Related Event Broker Provisioning and Configuration Information</p>
    <p>For JMS clients to publish messages within the Message VPN they are connected to, they must be assigned appropriately configured client profiles and/or Access Control List (ACL) profiles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To publish messages with a Guaranteed Transport delivery mode, clients must be assigned client profiles that have the <code>allow‑guaranteed‑message‑send</code> parameter enabled. </li>
      <li>To allow clients to publish messages to topics (or to only a specific set of topics) clients must be assigned ACLs with the appropriate access controls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on configuring client profiles and ACLs on event brokers, refer to <MadCap:xref MadCap:unresolvedLink="import-link:managing_cli_user_authentication_and_authorization_1105770511_49686" href="../../Admin/Configuring-Mgmt-and-Shell-Users.htm">Managing CLI User Authentication and Authorization</MadCap:xref>.</p>
