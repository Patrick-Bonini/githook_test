    <h1>Solace JNDI Objects</h1>
    <p>Java Messaging Service (JMS) provides a common way for an enterprise’s Java applications to create, send, receive, and read messages. As of version 10.20, the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> JMS API supports the JMS 2.0 standard.</p>
    <p>Java messaging applications can use the Solace implementation of the JMS Application Programming Interface (API) to connect to a Solace PubSub+ event broker.</p>
    <p>The event broker can provide JNDI service, which allows JMS clients to perform JNDI lookups and object binding. It also acts as a JMS broker, to access the messaging capabilities of Solace PubSub+. The event broker acts as the JMS broker for the JMS client. As such, it provides access control, message routing, selecting, and filtering.</p>
    <p>The event broker provides an internal JNDI store for provisioned Connection Factory, Topic, and Queue objects that clients can access through JNDI lookups.</p>
    <p>The Solace Guaranteed Messaging feature provides a message spooling mechanism to support the persistent store notion of JMS queues (when using a point-to-point messaging model) and subscription names (when using a publish‑subscribe messaging model).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical queues can be provisioned on an event broker through the Solace CLI (refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Configuring-Queues.htm">Configuring Queues</MadCap:xref>).</li>
      <li>Topic endpoints can be provisioned on an event broker through the Solace CLI (refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Configuring-DTEs.htm">Configuring Topic Endpoints</MadCap:xref>). These topic endpoints must have the same name as the subscription name that they represent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note">To use Guaranteed Messaging with JMS messaging, a Solace PubSub+ appliance must have an ADB installed with Guaranteed Messaging and message spooling enabled. For configuration information, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Managing-Guaranteed-Messaging.htm">Managing Guaranteed Messaging</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>This section describes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the tasks associated with configuring standard object properties and property lists in the JNDI store on an event broker.</li>
      <li>the Command Line Interface (CLI) commands used to manage administered objects in the JNDI store on an event broker.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note">Solace PubSub+ also supports JNDI lookups of administered objects maintained in an LDAP-based JNDI store on a remote host. However, this section only provides information on how to work with the JNDI store on an event broker. </p>
    <p>Solace Messaging API for JMS is JNDI‑compliant and accepts the standard JMS objects Connection Factory, Topic, and Queue.</p>
    <p>Standard JMS object properties and property lists can be configured in the JNDI store on the event broker. Through the JMS API, JNDI provides a standard way of accessing naming and directory services on the event broker that allows clients to discover and lookup data and objects through a common name.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="managing_solace_jndi_objects_1924398615_203390"/>Starting/Stopping JNDI Access</h2>
    <p>By default, JNDI access is not enabled on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> appliances for any VPNs. On <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> software event brokers, JNDI access is enabled by default for the default VPN and disabled by default for all other VPNs.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable JNDI access for clients, enter the following CONFIG command: 
                <p class="Code">solace(configure/jndi)# no shutdown</p></li>
      <li>To stop JNDI access for clients , enter the following CONFIG command:
                <p class="Code">solace(configure/jndi)# shutdown</p></li>
    </ul>
