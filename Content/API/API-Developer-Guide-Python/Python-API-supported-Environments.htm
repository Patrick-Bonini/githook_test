    <h3><a name="using-ide"/>Using an Integrated Development Environment</h3>
    <p>If you are using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as PyCharm, integrated help is available provided you have Docstrings rendered as reStructuredText. In some IDEs, you configure this in the settings. For example, in PyCharm, you go to <b>File &gt; Settings &gt;Tool &gt; Python Integrated Tools</b>, select <b>reStructureText</b> in the <b>Docstring format</b> list, and click <b>Apply</b>.</p>
