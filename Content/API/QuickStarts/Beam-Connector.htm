    <h1>Solace PubSub+ Connector for Beam: I/O</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-apache-beam" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Solace PubSub+ Connector for Beam: I/O</a> is  a component which allows for Apache Beam applications running in Google Cloud Dataflow to connect to and receive data from a Solace Event Mesh. </p>
    <p>Using the Beam I/O Connector, Apache Beam applications can receive messages from a Solace PubSub+ broker (appliance, software, or Solace Cloud messaging service) regardless of how messages were initially sent to the broker â€“ whether it be REST POST, AMQP, JMS, or MQTT. Also, by using an Apache Beam data runner these applications can be deployed onto various services, from which, the data they receive can be further processed by other I/O connectors to interact with other technologies such as Cloud BigQuery, Apache Cassandra, and so on. </p>
