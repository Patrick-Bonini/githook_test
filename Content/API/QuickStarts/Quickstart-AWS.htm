    <h1>AWS Quick Start</h1>
    <p>The AWS Quick Start automatically deploys PubSub+ event brokers into the AWS Cloud in about 20 minutes, in a configuration of your choice. The Quick Start is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/solace-pubsub/" target="_blank" class="link-internal">available here</a>.</p>
    <p>With this Quick Start, PubSub+ can be deployed in either a standalone configuration or in high-availability (HA) redundancy groups for fault tolerance.  In the HA configuration, if one of the event brokers fails, or is taken out of service, the other event broker automatically takes over and provides service to the clients of the event broker that is out of service.  To increase availability, the event brokers are deployed across three Availability Zones.</p>
    <p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation.  The Quick Start includes a guide with step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions.</p>
