    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Software"/>Default Configuration for Software Event Brokers</h1>
    <p> A Solace PubSub+ software event broker starts with a basic configuration that enables many common services that can be modified as required.</p>
    <p>The following services are included in the basic configuration.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The message spool is configured and enabled. The maximum spool usage is set to 1500 MB.</li>
      <li>The message VPN named <code>default</code> is enabled with no client authentication.</li>
      <li>The client username called <code>default</code> in the <code>default</code> Message VPN is enabled. The client username <code>default</code> has all settings enabled.</li>
      <li>All features are unlocked and do not require a product key.</li>
      <li>All services are enabled and the table below lists their default port numbers.</li>
      <p class="Note">TLS/SSL services will not become operational until a server certificate is installed.</p>
      <p class="Note">In cloud environments (for example, AWS), ports are typically blocked by the default security group. To access them, you have to allow access in the security group.</p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Default port numbers for services on <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/>s</b>
    </p>

    <h4>Reloading</h4>
    <p>When the Solace PubSub+ software event broker is reloaded (for example, using the CLI <code>reload</code> command), the current configuration is preserved. However, the Solace CLI command <code>enable&gt; reload default-config</code> will restore the software event broker to its initial basic configuration.</p>
