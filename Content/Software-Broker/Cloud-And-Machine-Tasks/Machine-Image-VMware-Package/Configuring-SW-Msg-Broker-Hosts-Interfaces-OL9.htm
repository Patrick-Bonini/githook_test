    <h1>Software Event Broker Host Interface Configuration</h1>
    <p>The default behavior for a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.CompanyName"/> <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> software event broker machine image in a hypervisor is to dynamically receive its IP address configuration from the host. Alternatively, you can also manually associate an IP interface with a host OS physical interface through the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.solace_cli"/> or configuration keys. However, before any host OS physical interface can be used by the event broker, it first must be configured on the host.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule">Configuring Interfaces with Static IP Addresses</h2>
    <p class="Note">Solace <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> software event brokers support only a single network interface. Configuring multiple interfaces  is not supported.</p>
    <p>To configure an interface with a static IPÂ address on the software event broker host, for eventual use in software event broker configuration, use the nmcli command line tool. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/9/network/OL9-NETWORK.pdf" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Setting Up Networking</a> in the Oracle Linux 9 documentation. </p>
    <h2 class="with-rule">Alternative DNS Server Configuration</h2>
    <p>To specify the use of alternative DNS servers, use the nmcli command line tool. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/9/network/OL9-NETWORK.pdf" target="_blank" class="link-offsite">Setting Up Networking</a> in the Oracle Linux 9 documentation.</p>
