    <h1>Configuring Client Authorization</h1>
    <p>After clients connecting to a Message VPN are authenticated, they must be authorized to access event broker resources and messaging capabilities. How much access that a client is authorized for is determined by the client profile and ACL profile it is assigned.</p>
    <p>Client profiles and ACL profiles can be assigned to clients based on the client usernames that they use (refer to <MadCap:xref href="Configuring-Client-Usernames.htm">Configuring Client Usernames</MadCap:xref>) or on an LDAP authorization group that they belong to (refer to <MadCap:xref href="Configuring-LDAP-Groups.htm">Configuring LDAP Authorization Groups</MadCap:xref>).</p>
    <p class="Note">Clients' access to endpoints is also determined by permission levels that are configured for each individual endpoint. For information on configuring queuesâ€™ permission levels for queues, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Configuring-Queues.htm#Configur19">Configuring Permissions for Non-Owner Clients</MadCap:xref>, for topic endpoints, refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Messaging/Guaranteed-Msg/Configuring-DTEs.htm#Configur26">Configuring Permissions for Non-Owner Clients</MadCap:xref>.</p>
