    <h1>IP Addressing in Cloud Instances</h1>
    <p>In the cloud, Solace PubSub+ software event broker IP addresses are provided through the cloud service provider and cannot be configured on the software event broker. Below are some notes and best practices.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A software event broker can use any number of public IP addresses but only a single private IP address.</li>
      <li>A software event broker can be addressed through any of its IP addresses, however the software event broker itself is only aware of its private address. For example, show commands will only show the internal address of the software event broker.</li>
      <li>Depending on the cloud provider, a user can control the IP addresses assigned to the software event broker. For example, in AWS, there are typically two IP addresses, public and private, which can be controlled through AWS with Elastic IP, and Virtual Private Cloud settings. Other cloud providers will allow IP addressing with similar features.</li>
      <li>When using Multi-Node Routing and bridges on the software event broker, care should be taken to ensure that security groups allow traffic to pass between software event brokers on all of the IP addresses in use.</li>
      <li>Multi-Node Routing neighbors contain security measures to ensure that other end of the neighbor is the correct destination. This check is based on the remote private IP address. </li>
      <li>When a software event broker is reachable through public and private IP addresses, it's preferred to use the internal address.</li>
      <li>When configuring high-availability (HA) redundancy for software event brokers, each node in the HA group must be configured with a private IP address, not a public IP address. Note that the private IP address can be displayed through the <code>show ip vrf management</code> command.</li>
    </ul>
