    <h1>Router Name Configuration</h1>
    <p>By default, the router name automatically mirrors the assigned hostname such that if the operator changes the hostname, the router name also changes to match it.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="How"/>Configuring with the Solace CLI</h2>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Not-Config-Synced.flsnp"/>
    <p>For a Solace PubSub+ event broker, if you want to configure a router name that is separate from the hostname, enter the following CONFIG command in the Solace CLI:</p>
    <p class="Code">solace(configure)# router-name &lt;name&gt; [defer]</p>
    <p><u>Where</u>:</p>
    <p><code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the router name. Router names can contain up to 64 characters, composed of alphanumeric characters 0 to 9, a to z, A to Z, underscore '_', dot '.', and hyphen '-'. Note that '_', '.' and '-' cannot be used at the beginning or end of a router name. Router names must be unique among all configured event brokers.</p>
    <p><code>defer</code> specifies that the name change is to be deferred until the next time an event broker restart occurs. If this option is not specified when the <code>router-name</code> CONFIG command is issued, the system prompts you to confirm the router name change, and then it automatically powers down and restarts the event broker.</p>
    <p>The <code>no</code> version of this command, <code>no router-name</code>, deletes the given name from the event broker, and it causes the router name to again mirror the hostname such that if the operator changes the hostname, the router name also changes to match it.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="How2"/>Configuring with Configuration Keys</h2>
    <p style="font-style: normal;">For a Solace PubSub+ software event broker  container, you can use the <code>routername</code> configuration key to set the router name that is used when the software event broker container is created.
