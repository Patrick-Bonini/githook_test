    <h1>Configuring File Transfer User Accounts</h1>
    <p>To create a new File Transfer user account, enter the following CONFIG command:
			<p class="Code">solace(configure)# create username &lt;name&gt; password &lt;password&gt; file-transfer</p></p>
    <p>To edit the properties for an existing File Transfer account, enter the following CONFIG command:
			<p class="Code">solace(configure)# username &lt;name&gt;</p></p>
    <p><u>Where</u>:</p>
    <p><code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the user name assigned to the file transfer user account. A file transfer account user name can contain up to 32 alphanumeric characters, and must be unique among all created CLI and File Transfer user accounts.</p>
    <p><code>&lt;password&gt;</code> is the password assigned to the file transfer user account. An account password can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters, and can be used with all created CLI and File Transfer user accounts. As a best practice, Solace recommends assigning unique passwords for each user account you create.</p>
    <p>The <code>no</code> version of this command, <code>no username</code>, deletes the specified user account from the event broker.</p>
    <div class="Caution">
      <p class="Tbl_Body"> An error message occurs if you attempt to log on to an event broker by SFTP or SCP with a user account name that has not been defined as a File Transfer user through the username Global CONFIG command.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note Â &lt;/b&gt;">
      <ul>
        <li>File Transfer user accounts do not have an access level associated with them. All File Transfer users can read, write, and delete files from the file system available to File Transfer users.</li>
        <li>When the Config-Sync facility is used for event brokers that are in redundant pairs and/or event brokers that are being replicated, by default any configuration you make through a <code>username</code> CONFIG command is also made to its redundant mate and/or replication mate. If you do not want these changes to be synchronized, you can disable the synchronization of <code>username</code> CONFIG commands. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Features/Config-Sync/Configuring-Config-Sync.htm#Enabling">Enabling Config-Sync</MadCap:xref>.</li>
