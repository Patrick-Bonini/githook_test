    <h1><MadCap:concept term="Software;Appliance"/>Creating a Client Username</h1>
    <p>Client usernames are used for client applications to authenticate and are associated with a client profile and ACL profile to control the permissions of the connecting client application. Client usernames are specific to a Message VPN.  They are used by client applications to authenticate with the event broker, and may be used to make multiple client connections.  This lets applications horizontally scale without additional configuration on the event broker. 
		Each client username is associated with a client profile and an ACL profile. These profiles control properties and permissions of the connected client application.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/BrokerManager/client-usernames-common.flsnp"/>
