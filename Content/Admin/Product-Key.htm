    <h1>Product Keys </h1>
    <p>Some features offered on Solace PubSub+ event brokers are locked and can only be accessed through a product key provided by Solace. </p>
    <p>For instructions for installing product keys, see <MadCap:xref href="Product-Key.htm#prod_key_locking2">Entering Product Keys to Unlock Services</MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Product"/>Product Keys on Appliances</h2>
    <p>In some cases a product key may have already been entered for an appliance before it was shipped to your site, in other cases you can manually enter a product key for an appliance that is already in use. To review the features that require a product key, see <MadCap:xref href="#Required">Appliance Features that Require Product Keys </MadCap:xref>.</p>
    <p>If a product key is added for a feature on an appliance, no existing product keys and unlocked features are affected. For example, if a product key for PubSub+ Cache service was already entered, and a new, combined product key for PubSub+ Cache service and High-performance Guaranteed Messaging
 is subsequently entered, the earlier PubSub+ Cache product key and the service that it unlocked remain, and no service or configuration changes occur for it.</p>
    <p>If a product key is removed, a system restart will be triggered and all configuration related to the features unlocked by that key will be lost if no other product key is currently registered for those features. For example, if you remove a product key for PubSub+ Cache, the appliance will restart if that was the only product key registered for PubSub+ Cache. However, if another product key for PubSub+ Cache service was registered (say the combined PubSub+ Cache and High-performance Guaranteed Messaging) because the use of PubSub+ Cache is still supported by a valid license, the appliance will not restart and any existing PubSub+ Cache configuration parameters will remain.</p>
    <h3><a name="Required"/>Appliance Features that Require Product Keys </h3>
    <p>Features that are locked on appliances include PubSub+ Cache service and optional higher-performance levels for some ADB models. </p>
    <div class="Note">
      <p>With the release of appliance version 8.4.0, product keys are not required on an appliance to use MQTT, OpenMAMA, or Web Transport services. On upgrading from an earlier version of Solace PubSub+, the MQTT, OpenMAMA, and, Web Transport services will be available on the appliance, regardless of whether the corresponding license keys are installed on that appliance or not. For HA and/or DR pair, you must upgrade all appliances to the latest version before enabling one of the newly unlocked protocols. Enabling the unlocked protocols before upgrading all the appliances in an HA and/or DR pair will result in config-sync failure due to missing license keys.</p>
    </div>
    <h4>PubSub+ Cache</h4>
    <p>A product key is required to enable PubSub+ Cache service on any appliance that is acting as a Designated Router. PubSub+ Cache provides a scalable, in-memory message cache for Direct messages.</p>
    <p class="Note">When the PubSub+ Cache service is locked, no aspect of it is configurable or enabled to be displayed. The CLI commands relating to the features are still visible in the Solace CLI, but the command fails to run when executed and returns an error message indicating the features are locked.</p>
    <h4>High-Performance Guaranteed Messaging</h4>
    <p>A product key is required to increase the Guaranteed Messaging performance of some ADBs installed in appliances (for example, ADB-000000-02 and ADB-04210M-01). This increase performance provides higher maximum ingress message rates (in msg/sec) and maximum ingress bandwidth (in Gbps).</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="Productkey_Software"/>Product Keys on Software Event Brokers </h2>
    <p>You can manually enter a product key to enable locked features for a software event broker. You can enter this key during container initialization using a configuration key (refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Software-Broker/Container-Tasks/Config-SW-Broker-Container-Cfg-Keys.htm">Configuration Key Usage</MadCap:xref>), or while the event broker is in use, via the CLI. To review the features that require a product key, see below.</p>
    <h3><a name="Software"/>Software Event Broker Features that Require Product Keys</h3>
    <p>On software event brokers, a product key is required to enable the optional increase to the Message VPN limit. In addition, you can use a product key  to upgrade from the Standard edition of the software event broker to the Enterprise edition, or  to try the Enterprise edition for 90 days.</p>
    <h4>Additional Message VPNs</h4>
    <p>A product key is required to enable additional Message VPNs on  Enterprise editions of PubSub+ software event brokers. When the key is entered, the maximum number of Message VPNs available on the event broker is increased to 26 (including the default Message VPN).</p>
    <p>Once a product key is added to enable additional Message VPNs it cannot be removed.</p>
    <h4>Upgrade to Enterprise Edition</h4>
    <p>In SolOS version 9.13.1 or later, you can use a product key to upgrade from the Standard edition to the Enterprise edition. <a href="../get-support.htm" class="link-internal">Contact Solace</a> to get the product key.</p>
    <h4>Evaluate the Enterprise Edition</h4>

    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="prod_key_unlock"/>Entering Product Keys to Unlock Services</h2>
    <p>To unlock a feature on a PubSub+ event broker that requires a product key, enter the following commands:</p>

    <p><u>Where</u>:</p>
    <p><code>&lt;key-value&gt;</code> is the Solace-provided product key</p>
    <p class="Tip">To determine whether a product key to unlock those optional features was pre-entered by Solace, enter the following command:</p>
    <p class="Code">solace&gt; show product-key</p>
    <p>Any product keys currently in use, and the features that they unlock, are displayed.</p>
