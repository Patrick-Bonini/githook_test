    <h1>Hostname Configuration</h1>
    <p>The default hostname for a <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.pubsub_brand_only"/> event broker is <code>solace</code>. Note that this hostname is typically used in the examples throughout this documentation. However, you should change the hostname through the <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.solace_cli"/> to something that is more descriptive and differentiates it from other event brokers. In addition, if you are using multi-node routing, you must configure unique hostnames because nodes in a multi-node network must have a unique router name.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="How"/>Appliances</h2>
    <p>For appliances, hostnames are typically configured through the <code>setup</code> Privileged EXEC command that is used to initially configure appliances (refer to <MadCap:xref href="../Appliance/Appliance-Set-Up/Initializing-Appliances.htm">Initially Setting Up Appliances</MadCap:xref>). However, you can also use the following commands to configure a new hostname for an event broker.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Not-Config-Synced.flsnp"/>
    <p>To configure an appliance hostname, do the following:
        </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter the following command to check the current host name and any deferred host name (that is, a host name that may be set to be applied on the next event broker restart):                <p class="Code">solace&gt; show hostname</p></li>
      <li>To change the hostname, enter the following commands:                <p class="Code">solace&gt; enable<br/>solace# configure<br/>solace(configure)# hostname &lt;name&gt; [defer]</p><p><u>Where</u>:</p><p><code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is the hostname of the event broker. Host names can contain up to 64 characters, composed of alphanumeric characters 0 to 9, a to z, A to Z,  periods (<code>.</code>), and hyphens (<code>-</code>). Note periods (<code>.</code>) and hyphens (<code>-</code>) cannot be used at the beginning or end of a hostname. Hostnames must be unique among all configured event brokers.</p><p><code>defer</code> specifies that the name change is to be deferred until the next time an event broker restart occurs. If this option is not specified when the <code>hostname</code> Global CONFIG command is issued, the system prompts you to confirm the hostname change, and then it automatically powers down and restarts the event broker.</p><p>The no version of this command, <code>no hostname</code>, resets the hostname to the default value of <code>solace</code></p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="How2"/>Software Event Broker Machine Images</h2>
    <p>For <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/> machine images, it is possible for hostnames to be automatically set in some environments. For example it is common in cloud environments for a configuration agent to set the hostname automatically when an instance is created. The event broker learns the hostname from the system the first time it starts up. Therefore, it is recommend that you do not  change the hostname from that which the cloud provider assigns. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.DockerChanges"> However, if necessary, you can change hostnames through the <code>solacectl</code> utility. For more information, see  <MadCap:xref href="../Software-Broker/Cloud-And-Machine-Tasks/Using-the-Solacectl-Utility.htm">Using the Solacectl Utility</MadCap:xref>.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="How3"/>Software Event Broker Containers</h2>
    <p style="font-style: normal;">For <MadCap:variable name="Product-Names.broker_sw_short"/> containers, the hostname is assigned when the container is created and cannot be changed afterward. You can set the hostname when creating the containers using the option <code>–-hostname</code> option with the <code>docker create</code> command.</p>
