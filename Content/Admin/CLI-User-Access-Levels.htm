    <h1>CLI User Access Levels</h1>
    <p>Each command offered through the Solace CLI has a particular scope and access level requirement. Therefore, a CLI user can only use a command offered through the CLI if that user’s configured access levels are sufficient for the scope of the command.</p>
    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/CLI-User-Access-Levels.flsnp"/>
    <p>For detailed information about the capabilities offered at each access level, refer to <MadCap:xref href="#CLI">CLI Command Access Level Capabilities</MadCap:xref>.</p>

    <h2 class="with-rule"><a name="CLI"/>CLI Command Access Level Capabilities</h2>
    <p>There are multiple possible global access levels and Message VPN access levels that can be assigned to a CLI user with various capabilities and limitations.</p>
    <p>CLI users only see commands that they are authorized to execute. This means, for example, that Help commands will not show unauthorized commands, and CLI tab‑completion will not complete a command for which the user is not authorized. In addition, wildcard characters used in CLI commands will not allow a user to see or access network resources, such as Message VPNs or client profiles, that they are not authorized for.</p>
