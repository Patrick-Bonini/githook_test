    <h1>CLI Command Reference</h1>
    <p>This section lists each of the commands available in the Solace PubSub+ event broker Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands are listed separately for each CLI level.</p>
    <p>The CLI is the interface to the software that you use to access Solace PubSub+ functionality. The CLI provides commands that you can use to perform various tasks, including configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting the software, network connectivity, and, for the Solace PubSub+ appliance, hardware.</p>
    <h2 class="with-rule">Conventions</h2>
    <p>The following conventions are used in the Solace CLIÂ documentation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples of CLI entries and responses are written in the following manner:
                <p class="Code">solace(configure)#</p></li>
      <li>When an item is enclosed with &lt; &gt; symbols, the information requested is a variable and required.
                <p><u>Example</u>:</p><p class="Code">interface &lt;interface-id&gt;</p></li>
      <li>When an item is enclosed with [ ] symbols, the information requested is optional.
                <p><u>Example</u>:</p><p class="Code">show logging debug [&lt;subsystem-id&gt;]</p></li>
      <li>When an item is enclosed by { } symbols, the information requested is a variable of which only one is required.
                <p><u>Example</u>:</p><p class="Code">boot {&lt;version&gt; | backout}</p></li>
      <li>When an item is not enclosed by &lt; &gt;, [ ], or { } symbols, the item is a required keyword.
                <p><u>Example</u>:</p><p class="Code">show router name</p></li>
      <li>When two or more options are separated by a | symbol, you may at most enter one of the options as part of the command.
